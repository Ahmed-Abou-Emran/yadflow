# Agent skills (all 38)

The CLI **installs and wires** the module; the skills below are the **agents you invoke by name** in your
AI IDE (e.g. *"run `yad-epic`"*) to actually do the work. State lives in files you can also edit
directly. Each skill stops at a gate and never auto-advances unless the team set a Build step to `auto` with `yad dial`.

**These are the defaults, not a fixed wiring.** Which skill runs a lifecycle step is a project
setting: `yad skill bind <step> <skill>` records your own in `.sdlc/skills.json`, and `yad next` names
that one from then on — for every epic, or with `--profile <route>` for epics on one route only.
Several skills on one step run as a chain, in order. See
[choosing the skill for a step](CLI.md#choosing-the-skill-for-a-step). For skills worth binding,
`yad skill recommend` lists hand-picked ones from the recommended pools, with the reason and the bind
command for each ([the catalogue](CLI.md#recommended-skills-the-catalogue)).

For an introduction see the [README](../README.md); for the step-by-step path see
[`WALKTHROUGH.md`](WALKTHROUGH.md) or the [team guide](../TEAM-GUIDE.md). A condensed "when do I reach
for it" table is in the [team guide §11](../TEAM-GUIDE.md).

## Setup & code-awareness

- **`yad-connect-repos`** — Connects code repos to the Product so the front/"brain" phases are
  code-aware. Registers N code repos (GitHub or GitLab, local-user auth, no stored tokens) into
  `.sdlc/repos.json`, then caches an AI-readable picture of each — a compressed Repomix pack and a
  lightweight code-map (existing endpoints/events/data-models/modules), secret-scanned. Idempotent and
  refreshable; staleness tracked by HEAD sha. Also drafts each code repo's **risk map**
  (`.sdlc/risk-map`, in the code repo): one line per directory saying `high`, `medium` or `low`, no names.
  The AI reads the code — not folder names — and marks each level `guessed`; a person confirms it in a PR.
  One exception: `.sdlc/` is `high`, because it holds the map.
- **`yad-sync-repos`** — Brings every connected repo up to date in one shot: switches each repo in
  `.sdlc/repos.json` to its `default_branch` and fast-forwards it from origin (local-user git, no stored
  tokens). A working-tree-only maintenance op — never a gate, never writes the registry. A dirty repo is
  skipped and reported (never overwritten); a diverged branch is left for manual resolution. Drives
  `yad repo sync [name]`.
- **`yad-connect-design`** — Connects a design tool (Figma-first, pluggable) so the UI step can
  materialize the actual feature design (mobile screens / web pages) inside it, alongside the Markdown.
  Records the tool + project/file references in `.sdlc/design.json` (local-user / MCP-session auth, no
  stored tokens), detecting the design-tool MCP and degrading to markdown-only when absent. Idempotent
  and refreshable; one connection per project.
- **`yad-connect-testing`** — Connects a testing tool (Playwright-first, pluggable) so the test-cases
  step can implement the actual automation tests inside it, alongside the Markdown. Records the tool +
  project/suite references in `.sdlc/testing.json` (local-user / MCP-session auth, no stored tokens),
  detecting the testing-tool MCP and degrading to artifacts-only when absent. Idempotent and
  refreshable; one connection per project.
- **`yad-connect-learning`** — Connects a learning/tutoring tool (DeepTutor-first, pluggable) so the
  cross-cutting learning layer can tutor any team member in the context of what's being built. Records
  the tool + an optional grounded knowledge base in `.sdlc/learning.json` (local-user auth, no stored
  tokens), detecting the **DeepTutor CLI on PATH** (a subprocess like Repomix — DeepTutor ships no MCP)
  and degrading to **harness-native** tutoring when absent. Idempotent and refreshable; one connection
  per project.
- **`yad-connect-docs`** — Connects a docs/Pages target (GitHub Pages / GitLab Pages, auto-detected from
  `product.json`) so the generated documentation sites can deploy. Records the target + scope + base path in
  `.sdlc/docs.json` (local-user auth, no stored tokens), degrading to **build-only** when no Pages host /
  CLI is present. Idempotent and refreshable; one connection per project.

## Living documentation (generated, themed, auto-kept-fresh)

- **`yad-docs`** — Generates an **interactive documentation site** for an epic (a React + Vite + Tailwind
  SPA: an animated front-stage flow canvas + role-based stakeholder doc pages) from the authored
  artifacts — `epic.md`, `architecture.md`, the locked `contract.md`, `ui-design.md`, the stories — into
  `epics/EP-<slug>/docs-site/`, themed by the **connected design system** (`DESIGN.md` / `design.json`
  tokens → the site's CSS). The content lives in generated `src/data/*.ts`; the shell is a vendored
  template. An **output enrichment, never a gate** — it never touches epic state, approvals, or the
  contract lock. `generate` / `refresh` / `deploy`.
- **`yad-docs-overview`** — Generates the project **SDLC-overview site** (`docs/sdlc-site/`) — every
  stage from setup → ship as flow paths / system components / stakeholder roles, reusing the same shell.
  The hand-maintained report (`docs/sdlc-site/public/report.html`) stays the **main documentation** at
  the Pages root (served as both `report.html` and `index.html`); the interactive site mounts under
  `app/`, is reached from the report, and links back to it. Deploys with `yad docs deploy --overview`.
- **`yad-docs-sync`** — Keeps the sites fresh: detects staleness (a content hash of the authored
  artifacts + the connected repos' HEAD shas vs each site's build manifest), regenerates + redeploys on
  request, and can wire a CI job that builds and deploys every site on push. That job builds only what is
  committed, so regenerating a stale site stays a person's `refresh`. Generalizes the rule that feature
  work must hand-update the docs.

## The learning layer (cross-cutting — any member, any stage)

- **`yad-learn`** — At **any** SDLC stage, a team member can ask to learn a concept and be tutored *in
  the context of what the team is building* — e.g. *"teach me why the architecture hash-locks the
  contract surface"*. Routes the request to the connected learning tool (`.sdlc/learning.json`,
  DeepTutor-first) grounded in the project knowledge base, or degrades to **harness-native** tutoring
  (the harness model reading the artifacts) when nothing is connected — so it always works. Renders a
  tutorial artifact and appends to a per-member **learning ledger** kept **local-only** (gitignored,
  never committed or pushed — to the Product or any code repo) so it stays a private, personal **skills log**
  (`yad-status` rolls up the local records). **Purely opt-in — it never blocks a gate** and
  never touches epic state, approvals, or the contract lock. *AI builds, the hand decides* — and now the
  hand can also learn, on demand, what it is deciding about.

## Foundation — frame the whole product (the Product level: once per product, optional, human-gated)

- **`yad-discovery`** — writes the **Foundation**, for **greenfield and brownfield**. The engine seeds
  its ledger first with `yad foundation new`; then, with the analyst and pm, the skill writes one file
  per section into `foundation/` (the fixed id `EP-foundation`): `purpose.md`, `market.md` (optional),
  `scope.md` — what it is **and what it is not** — `mvp.md`, `roadmap.md`, `stack.md`, `repos.md` and
  `risks.md` (optional). In greenfield it writes them with the user one section at a time, in that
  order, from the questions its schema gives for each section (what to ask, what a good answer holds,
  what the reviewer checks). In brownfield, `stack.md` and `repos.md` are based on the connected code. A
  section still holding only its template makes `yad gate open` and `yad gate sync` warn "Foundation not
  written yet", and `yad doctor` reports it (`foundation:unwritten`) once the review has opened or
  passed — a warning, never a refusal. It is
  gated by the same review gate (one approver holds it); on approval it terminates at
  `foundation-done` (no Build). The roadmap puts that approval "before feature work begins" — in this
  release that is **reported by `yad next`, not enforced**. Its `roadmap.md` is the menu of features —
  each `yad-epic` reads it for product context (reference-only; the Foundation never auto-seeds epics).
  Its `Status` column is not kept by hand: `yad foundation status` reads how far each feature has got
  from the epic ledgers.
  A product made before E75 may still have the old spelling, `epics/EP-discovery/`; see
  [shape 8](migrations/shape-8.md).

## Shape — author the "thinking" (once per epic, human-gated)

- **`yad-analysis`** — *Optional* Shape step 1. With the analyst, pressure-test a feature idea
  and write the discovery brief into `analysis.md`. Assigns the `EP-<slug>` ID and seeds `.sdlc/` state
  (the 12-step chain that puts analysis before epic). If skipped, the epic step does this shaping inline.
- **`yad-epic`** — The epic Shape step. Shape the idea with the analyst (or read `analysis.md`
  when it already ran), then write the epic with the pm into `epic.md`. The entry point when analysis is
  skipped: assigns the `EP-<slug>` ID and seeds `.sdlc/` state.
- **`yad-architecture`** — Shape step 3. With the architect, author `architecture.md` and the
  locked `contract.md` (the shared cross-repo surface), then hash-lock the contract surface into
  `.sdlc/contract-lock.json`. Reads `epic.md`; its review carries the `contract` risk tag, so the reported approval count is 3.
- **`yad-ui`** — Shape step 5. With the ux-designer, author `ui-design.md` and `DESIGN.md`,
  driving Impeccable as harness slash-commands (document/extract/craft) when installed, or authoring
  directly when not. When a design tool is connected (`yad-connect-design`), also **materializes the
  feature design** — mobile screens / web pages — in the tool (generate or link), recording the
  screen→frame map in `design-links.json`; degrades to markdown-only otherwise. Reads epic + architecture.
  **Optional** — an epic with no user-facing surface (backend/API, data, infra) skips it, keeping the
  step visible and auditable, with `yad skip <epic> ui-design --reason "<why>"` (reverse with `yad unskip <epic> ui-design`
  until the stories review opens). An epic that will have screens later can `yad defer` the step instead — with `--debt` when it is owed back — and `yad undefer` picks it up again at any time, even after the stories are done. On a verified Product these verbs refuse once the epic's first review PR has merged, because CI owns `state.json`.
- **`yad-stories`** — Shape step 7. With the pm, break the approved epic into user stories, each
  tagged with the repos that must implement it. Assigns zero-padded `EP-<slug>-S0N` IDs, one file per
  story under `stories/`. Reads epic + architecture + contract + UI.
- **`yad-test-cases`** — Shape step 9, a **parallel, non-blocking** track: it opens when the stories
  gate passes (the epic is already `ready-for-build`, so Build runs alongside it). With the
  test architect, author `test-cases.md` covering the approved stories (risk-based P0–P3 cases +
  story→case traceability). When a testing tool is connected (`yad-connect-testing`), also **implements
  the automation tests** in the connected code repo(s) (generate or link), recording the case→test map in
  `test-links.json`; degrades to artifacts-only otherwise. Reads epic + architecture + contract + UI +
  stories.

## The review gate (cross-cutting — used by every review)

- **`yad-review-gate`** — The reusable team review + approve gate. Shares an authored artifact, records
  reviewer comments and approvals as files (each under the reviewer's platform login — there are no
  roles), holds the gate until **one person other than the author** approves, reports the full approval
  count (a `contract` tag asks 3, `auth`/`payments` 2 — advisory) capped at the live number of
  active people less one, and advances the
  epic state **only** when approval is recorded. When the count of people suggests a gate may not pass,
  `yad gate status` and `yad gate sync` print a warning line (`! may not be met: …` or
  `! if the risk step were enforced: …`); it holds nothing (E73). In solo mode, `yad gate status` instead
  suggests `yad mode team` (`! solo mode is on, but …`) when more than one person may work on the
  Product; it switches nothing (E74). A gate already passed is taken back only by `yad gate reopen`,
  before Build starts (#322).
- **`yad-review-companion`** — The fun, easy, transparent layer on top of the gate (front **and**
  Build). Generates a 60-sec AI **trailer** of what changed + where the risk is, deals swipe-through
  review **cards**, and runs a grounded **chat** where a reviewer's questions become the record. Records
  an **engagement** signal on each approval (`verified` vs `none`) and posts a friendly public nudge on a
  bare rubber-stamp. Soft by default ("visible, not impossible"); gates only when
  `review.requireEngagement` (Product settings). Companion comments carry `<!-- yad:noblock -->` so they never block.
- **`yad-pair-review`** — The guided, two-way, **teaching** walkthrough — the AI-driven 5th companion
  face (front **and** Build). The AI walks the engineer through the change **one risk-ordered stop at
  a time** (`yad review walkthrough` / `yad gate walkthrough`), gives comprehensive context per change,
  then **asks them about it**; the engineer answers and asks back until **both are satisfied** (dual
  sign-off). It doubles as a learning session — demonstrates a transferable review method, scores the
  engineer, and records their review-skill growth in the **local-only** `yad-learn` ledger (the `yad-status`
  skill rolls it up). Soft and additive: never blocks, rides the same `engagement: verified` signal, and
  surfaces genuine concerns as normal blocking comments.
- **`yad-product-bridge`** — The templated PR/MR bridge for the Shape gate. When the Product has a platform
  (`.sdlc/product.json`), it opens a review PR/MR per artifact, applies the touched-domain labels (it requests no reviewers), and
  provides the read-only `gh`/`glab` recipes that sync platform comments + approvals back into the file
  ledger. The file ledger stays the source of truth; degrades to a local gate with no platform, where
  `yad gate approve`, `yad gate comment` and `yad gate advance` record the review (E112).

## Build — turn stories into shipped code (once per story, per repo)

- **`yad-spec`** — Step A. For one ready-for-build story and one of its repos, run the Spec Kit ceremony
  once (specify → clarify → plan → analyze → checklist → tasks) → `specs/<story-id>/`. Drives `/speckit.*`
  when installed; references the locked contract — never re-invents the surface. Before the long work,
  it asks every human-only decision (security trade-offs, secrets and tokens, contract changes, changes
  that cannot be undone) and every open question in one batch, and records the answers in `spec.md`
  (#357).
- **`yad-implement`** — Step B. With the dev lens, implement **one** atomic task as a small diff
  (≤3 files) on its own branch. The diff stays inside the files the task declared (flag and STOP if it
  would grow). Commit ends with the task ID; `Contract-Change: yes` only if it touches the locked
  contract surface. Before any code, it asks in one batch the human-only decisions `spec.md` has not
  answered yet (#357).
- **`yad-checks`** — Step C, the production-safety gates. Wire and run the CI gates: **spec-link**
  (every change links a real story/spec), **contract-check** (a contract-surface diff without a
  re-locked contract FAILS), **build/test/lint**, **verified-commits** (every commit platform-signed),
  and the **pattern gates** — **commit-message** (Conventional subject + trailer order), **pr-title**,
  and **pr-template** (the PR/MR body uses the template), plus the advisory **risk-map** check (warns,
  never fails, when the repo's `.sdlc/risk-map` is stale for the change, and prints the approver count:
  a change touching a directory the base branch's map marks `high` asks for one more — E66 — and names
  who has committed there in the last 30 days, the people who can meet that ask — E67). Also wires **yad-update-guard** — a
  push-on-default workflow that re-checks any direct-to-default commit (e.g. from `yad update --push`)
  with just **verified-commits** + **commit-message**. Profile-aware (`code`|`product`), so they run on
  both code repos and the Product. CI-agnostic bash for GitHub Actions and GitLab CI. Also
  installs the **agent guardrail** on a verified Product — `hooks/ledger-guard.mjs`, a harness hook that
  refuses an agent the CI-owned ledger write up front and names `yad gate open`, rather than letting
  `ledger-guard` reject it in CI twenty minutes later (#171) — and the same rule for a person: a git
  **pre-commit** hook (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`, per clone) that refuses a commit of a CI-owned ledger
  file (E48). On every Product, in both ledger modes, it also installs the **capture** post-edit hook
  (`hooks/yad-capture.mjs`), which snapshots each changed Shape draft to the person's private
  `yad/wip/<name>/<epic>` branch (E43). `"capture": false` in the Product settings turns it off.
- **`yad-pr-template`** — Step D. Detect the repo's platform and commit the matching PR/MR template with
  an Impact & Risk block; `high` risk adds 1 to the approval count and a touched contract surface adds 2.
  A `high` directory on the base branch's risk map adds 1 too, the larger step winning (E66).
  Includes `risk-route.sh` plus the `pr-title.sh` / `pr-template.sh` gate scripts.
- **`yad-commit`** — build helper. Commit ONE staged atomic change by the conventions (Conventional
  subject, `Task → Contract-Change → Ledger-Override → Co-Authored-By` trailers, the `--ai` co-author
  footer, the ≤3-file atomic guard). `--manual --reason "<why>"` commits past the ledger pre-commit hook
  and records the reason as a `Ledger-Override:` trailer; the ledger-guard check on the PR still fails
  it (E49). Drives `yad commit`.
- **`yad-open-pr`** — build helper. Open a code-repo task PR/MR from the committed template: push the
  branch, prefill the body, assign the committer (no reviewers are requested). Once it is open, prints a
  reviewer **suggestion** (E68): who has committed in the touched folders in the last 30 days, and what
  CODEOWNERS lists — a hint only, never a request. Bases the PR on the repo's **resolved
  default branch** (`--base` → `repos.json` → for a PR against the Product itself, `product.json`'s
  `default_branch` → the platform → `origin/HEAD` → `main`), and
  warns when the base is not the platform default — a mis-based PR silently gets no AI first pass.
  Drives `yad open-pr`.
- **`yad-ship`** — build helper. Commit **and** open the task PR/MR in one step (`yad commit` then
  `yad open-pr`; the PR step runs only if the commit lands). Drives `yad ship`.
- **`yad-engineer-review`** — Step E. AI review (CodeRabbit, advisory) → engineer review (the human gate,
  one approver holds the merge, with the same reported count) → on merge, record the ship in the epic build-log and
  update the story state so the epic → story → task → PR chain stays traceable.
- **`yad-backfill`** — Step G. Generate specs for already-built features in an existing repo so new work
  doesn't break them: pack one feature at a time with Repomix, write a DRAFT spec, require human approval
  before it counts. A change is blocked only until the features it touches have approved specs. Its
  `promote` action flips a brownfield stub epic (`yad-stub`) to a real, verified feature epic once the
  feature's backfill spec is approved.

## Automation & status

- **`yad-run`** — The Phase 4 orchestrator. Drives a story's Build loop (spec → tasks → implement →
  checks) on each step's advance dial, recording every run in the trust log. A clean `checks` pass on
  auto advances to engineer-review; any failure, scope overrun, or contract-surface touch HALTS for a
  human, and so does a skill that stopped to ask its human-only questions (no trust entry then: the
  step's output is not finished). Sets a step's dial through `yad dial` (nothing to earn since E34) and flips the kill switch
  through `yad kill` / `yad unkill`. It
  never drives a lane skipped whole with `yad skip <epic> <story> --repo <name>` (E39), and never marks a
  single Build step skipped.
- **`yad-status`** — Read-only view of an epic: the current step, each step's dials (driver/advance) and status, which approvals are still required, per-story Build run records (as advice),
  the kill switch and the Shape dials from `.sdlc/automation.json`, and a fleet roll-up across epics.
  It starts from `yad status --brief` (#349), the ~20-line view of where the work stands.
- **`yad-report`** — Self issue reporter. When a `yad` flow breaks, files a bug in the upstream
  yadflow repo with **auto-scrubbed** diagnostics — only the yadflow/node/os version, tool
  present+authenticated booleans, the Product platform enum, the error code/hint, a path-scrubbed
  message, and the failing command + flag *names*; never paths, hostnames, git URLs, repo names,
  logins, epic/story IDs, branch names, or flag values. Searches open issues first (dedupe), previews
  the exact payload and asks before posting, then files via an authenticated `gh`/`glab` or a
  prefilled `issues/new` URL. Also **offered automatically** after an unexpected failure (interactive
  only; `YAD_NO_REPORT=1` or `SDLC_NONINTERACTIVE` disables it). Never a gate; never touches epic state.

## Post-lock change management — feature threads (Phase 6)

After the contract locks and code ships, a change must **not** mutate a locked artifact — it becomes a
**new epic threaded to its parent**. A feature is a *thread* of linked epics (genesis → change → defect →
…); a change-epic **inherits** the Shape artifacts it does not change (by reference) and **re-authors**
only what it does. So artifacts never go stale — they are *superseded*; the feature's current truth is the
head of the thread. This is what keeps the SDLC a trusted source of truth for AI on the next change.

- **`yad-change`** — the intake + triage. Classifies the change *depth* (defect-fix /
  behavioral-no-surface / contract-surface / new-capability), writes a new `EP-<slug>` threaded to its
  parent (lineage frontmatter and `change.json`), seeds its ledger with `yad epic new --parent` (the
  inherited-step `state.json` and a pointer-lock `contract-lock.json` — E42), and for hotfixes opens
  `reconcile-debt.json`. Never auto-advances — hands off to the
  normal authoring skills + the review gate.
- **`yad-timeline`** — render the thread as an evolution view (yad-docs shell + `TIMELINE.md`) and emit
  `thread-resolved.md`, the composed **current-truth map** (which epic owns each artifact now).
- **`yad-defects`** — a per-epic/per-thread quality-gap report aggregating defects by **`escape_stage`**
  (the gate that should have caught it) + `root_cause` — *where the SDLC leaks*, so the team hardens the
  originating stage.
- **`yad-reconcile`** — a read-only drift/orphan/debt sweep across threads (mirrors `yad-docs-sync`; never
  a gate). The hard block is the CI gates.
- **`yad-stub`** — mint a **stub genesis epic** for a brownfield feature that has *no* epic, so a
  defect/change can thread off it today (`yad-change` needs a real parent). The stub is the smallest real
  thread anchor — type `feature`, `stub: backfill-pending`, `verified: false` — never inventing
  behaviour; `yad-backfill promote` flips it to a real, verified feature epic once its spec is approved.

Three CI gates (in `yad-checks`) enforce it: **lineage-check** (a change links a real threaded epic),
**epic-open** (a *sealed* epic — all stories shipped — refuses new behaviour, forcing a change-epic so the
Shape artifacts can never go stale), and **reconcile-debt** (a thread with open hotfix debt is frozen
until paid). Two read-only CLIs surface it: `yad thread <epic>` (the thread + resolved truth + open debt)
and `yad reconcile` (the drift sweep).
