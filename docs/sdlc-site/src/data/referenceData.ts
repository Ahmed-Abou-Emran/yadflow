Nothing is stored. A source that cannot be read makes it "NOT COUNTED" rather than a number, because a small count lowers what a gate asks for. Then no cap is shown. The cap is not enforced yet because the count of people can read high: a git name and a platform login are two people until proven one, so a two-person team can read as four.
