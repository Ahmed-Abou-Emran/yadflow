# Releasing

The `yad` CLI is published to npm as **`yadflow`**. The publish itself is **automated**
with [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/): there is no manual `npm publish` in the
steady state. **The decision to release is not automated.** Nothing reaches `yadflow@latest` until a
person fast-forwards the `release` branch to `main` (roadmap rule: *a release is a human decision*).
This doc covers the one-time bootstrap and the ongoing flow.

> **Renamed at v1.4.0.** The package was previously published as `@abdelrahmannasr/sdlc-workflow`
> (through v1.3.2); that scoped package is **deprecated** and points here. Same CLI, same repo —
> the GitHub repo was renamed `sdlc-workflow` → `yadflow` (old URLs redirect). The trusted-publisher
> registration is per-package, so `yadflow` needed its own bootstrap (steps A–B below).

## How it works

Three branches take part:

- **`main`** — where PRs merge. Merging to `main` **never publishes**.
- **`release`** — publishes to `yadflow@latest`, what `npx yadflow` and a plain `npm install` give
  people. A person moves it with a fast-forward: `git push origin origin/main:release`.
- **`next`** — publishes to `yadflow@next`, the **pre-release** channel
  (`.releaserc.json` → `{ "name": "next", "prerelease": true }`). Versions land as, for example, `4.0.0-next.1` and
  reach only people who ask for them by name. `latest` is untouched.

Both publishing branches run the same release check first.

`.github/workflows/release.yml` runs **only** on those two publishing branches. Nothing about a merge
to `main` starts it.

The workflow has two jobs, and the second cannot start without the first:

**1. `release check`** — `scripts/release-check.sh`. Nine steps, each one a way an upgrade could hurt
somebody:

| # | Step | What it protects against |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | tests + coverage | the ordinary bar, at the configured floors |
| 2 | the golden compatibility test | a real frozen v3 project reading differently than it did (rule 6) |
| 3 | `yad migrate --preview` on that project | an upgrade path that cannot even be planned — and it proves the preview writes nothing |
| 4 | a fresh install of the packed tarball, then `yad setup` | a `files` mistake, or a release that cannot create a project |
| 5 | `yad doctor` on the project that install just created | a release whose own health check fails on its own output |
| 6 | the migration guide, if the file shape moved | shipping a shape change with no page explaining it (rule 7) |
| 7 | the gate-sync fragments ship the major this release publishes (`scripts/pin-major-check.sh`) | a CI fragment that `yad update` wires into every verified Product, still trusting the old major — it would reject every version stamp the new release writes and run the old engine against the new file shape, in CI, without a word |
| 8 | every toolbox tool and recommended skill was vetted recently (`scripts/vet-check.mjs`) | shipping a tool whose licence and official source nobody has read in the last 180 days (E88) |
| 9 | the lifecycle defaults earlier releases shipped are unchanged (`scripts/lifecycle-defaults-check.sh`) | a team's lifecycle file copied from a default that has since changed under it — the three-way upgrade (E141) would then merge against the wrong starting point (E134) |

It checks out with `persist-credentials: false`: this job only reads, and the token that can bypass
branch protection has no business being in scope while the test suite runs. Run it yourself any time
with `npm run release-check`.

**2. `release`** — only if the check passed. It:

1. installs deps (`npm ci`),
2. runs `npx semantic-release`, which:
   - reads the [Conventional Commits](CONTRIBUTING.md) since the last release to pick the next version
     (`fix:`/`perf:`/`revert:` → patch, `feat:` → minor, a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer → major — a `!` in the
     subject alone is NOT a major under this repo's `angular` preset;
     `docs:`/`chore:`/`ci:`/`test:`/`refactor:` → nothing),
   - regenerates `CHANGELOG.md` and ships it **inside the npm tarball**,
   - **publishes to npm via tokenless Trusted Publishing (OIDC) with build provenance** — no `NPM_TOKEN`,
   - commits the regenerated `CHANGELOG.md` + `package.json` + `package-lock.json` back to the branch
     it ran on — now **`release`**, not `main` (`@semantic-release/git` pushes `HEAD:<branch>`),
   - pushes the `vX.Y.Z` git tag and cuts a GitHub release with the notes.

**The test suite runs a second time, inside the publish — after the tag is already pushed.**
`package.json` has `"prepublishOnly": "npm test"`, kept on purpose as the last guard for a manual
`npm publish` (step A), which no workflow gates. semantic-release runs its plugins in this order:

1. `@semantic-release/changelog` writes `CHANGELOG.md`, and `@semantic-release/npm` writes the new
   version into `package.json`;
2. `@semantic-release/git` commits `chore(release): X.Y.Z` and pushes it to the branch;
3. semantic-release pushes the `vX.Y.Z` tag;
4. `@semantic-release/npm` runs `npm publish`, which runs `prepublishOnly`, which runs `npm test`.

So at step 4 the suite runs in conditions the release check never had: `package.json` carries the new
version (a pre-release suffix like `-next.1` on `next`), and the environment carries the publisher's git
identity (`GIT_AUTHOR_*` / `GIT_COMMITTER_*` set to `semantic-release-bot`). **If a test fails there, the
version is burned:** the tag and the release commit are already on GitHub, but npm got nothing, and npm
never lets a version number be used twice. This has happened twice:

| Version | Why the publish-time test failed | Fixed in |
|---|---|---|
| `3.19.0-next.1` | a test expected a plain `X.Y.Z` version and failed on the `-next.1` suffix | #213 |
| `4.0.0-next.2` | four tests made git commits that picked up the bot's identity from the environment | #281 |

**Recovery:** fix the cause on `main` through a normal PR, bring any release commit back to `main`, and
push the publishing branch again. semantic-release sees the burned tag and cuts the **next** number
(`4.0.0-next.3` after `4.0.0-next.2`). Never delete the burned tag or force-push the branch to reuse
the number: the tag and the release commit are public history, and a skipped number costs nothing.

Auth is the `id-token: write` permission in the workflow plus the npm trusted-publisher entry — there is
no long-lived secret to rotate. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every pull request into `main` and
every push to `main`:

- the test matrix — Linux on Node 18, 20 and 22, and macOS on Node 22;
- the end-to-end harness against the packed tarball, on Linux and macOS;
- lint, the 70% coverage gate, and the tarball-leak smoke (Linux, Node 22);
- `npm audit` of production dependencies (failing on high severity), and a check of the registry
  signatures.

OpenSSF Scorecard runs as its own workflow (`.github/workflows/scorecard.yml`), weekly and on every push
to `main`.

`main` is protected with a required review, so **every PR into `main` needs an approval or an admin
merge** (`gh pr merge --squash --admin`). That is unchanged by E105 and is separate from releasing.

## One-time setup (already done once per package)

npm's trusted-publisher config lives on the package's settings page, so the package must exist first.

### A. Bootstrap with one manual publish

```bash
npm login                                          # handles 2FA OTP if enabled
git checkout feat/sdlc-cli                          # the branch that carries package.json
npm publish --access public --provenance=false      # provenance only works inside CI (OIDC)
```

This creates the package on npm. semantic-release derives the next version from git tags (the repo's
existing `vX.Y.Z` tags carry over the version line — the first `yadflow` release continues from the last
scoped tag, e.g. v1.3.2 → v1.4.0 on a `feat:`), so the first automated release lands cleanly on top.
*(If `--provenance=false` is rejected, use `NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE=false npm publish --access public`.)*

### B. Register the trusted publisher

On **npmjs.com → the package page → Settings → Trusted Publisher → GitHub Actions**:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Organization or user | `abdelrahmannasr` |
| Repository | `yadflow` |
| Workflow filename | `release.yml` *(filename only, not a path)* |
| Environment | *(leave blank)* |

Save. From here on, CI publishes tokenlessly with provenance.

### C. GitHub repo permissions

Repo → **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions** → **Read and write permissions**, and
check **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**. (Needed for the git tag push and the
GitHub release.) The source repo must also be **public** — npm provenance is rejected for private repos.

### D. Release PAT for the commit-back (`RELEASE_TOKEN`)

`@semantic-release/git` pushes the `chore(release)` commit to the publishing branch. Today the rules on
`release` and `next` (step E) block only deletion and force pushes, so that fast-forward push needs no
bypass. The token is kept only so the commit-back keeps working if those branches ever get a stricter
rule. While it exists, the job also hands it to `@semantic-release/github`, which uses it for the GitHub
release and to comment on released PRs and issues. Provision it like this:

1. Create a **fine-grained PAT** (GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Fine-grained tokens), scoped
   to the `yadflow` repo, with **Contents: Read and write**, **Pull requests: Read and write**, and
   **Issues: Read and write** (the last two let `@semantic-release/github` comment on released PRs/issues).
   The token owner should be a repo admin, so the token keeps working if a stricter rule is ever added.
2. Add it as a repo secret: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**, named
   **`RELEASE_TOKEN`**.
3. The rulesets on `release` and `next` have **no bypass list**, and need none (step E). The one bypass
   in this flow is a person's own: the sync-back push to `main` (step 4 of *Cutting a release*), which
   only works for a repo admin, because `main` requires a review and does not enforce it on admins.

Rotate the PAT before it expires. When `RELEASE_TOKEN` is missing, the workflow falls back to
`GITHUB_TOKEN`. That can still push the fast-forward commit-back under today's rules, but it cannot bypass
any stricter rule added later.

### E. Protect the publishing branches

Pushing a publishing branch **is** the act of shipping, so both are protected by a ruleset
(Settings → Rules → Rulesets):

| | |
|---|---|
| **Target** | `release` and `next` — **both done** (two rulesets, one per branch) |
| **Rules** | *Restrict deletions* and *Block force pushes*. Nothing else |
| **Bypass** | none |

Those two rules stop released history being rewritten and stop the branch being deleted, while leaving
the ordinary fast-forward that performs a release untouched.

**Three rules to deliberately NOT enable on these branches:**

- **Require a pull request.** A release is a fast-forward push. This rule would block it outright.
- **Require signed commits.** The `chore(release)` commit is written by `semantic-release-bot` and is
  unsigned; this would fail every release at the commit-back.
- **Require status checks.** The release check runs *on* the push, so it cannot gate that push. The
  gating already happens through the job dependency in `release.yml`.

This repo is user-owned rather than in an organization, so "restrict who can push" is not available and
there is one account with write access anyway. These rules protect against accident, not against a
second person; the real gate on a release is the check job.

## Cutting a release (ongoing)

1. Merge PRs to `main` with Conventional-Commit titles (**squash-merge** keeps the PR title as the
   commit subject, which is what semantic-release reads).
   - `feat: …` → minor, `fix: …`/`perf: …`/`revert: …` → patch, a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer → major.
     A `feat!:` subject WITHOUT that footer is no release at all under the `angular` preset this repo
     uses — the release check (`scripts/release-type.mjs`) asks semantic-release's own analyzer.
   - `docs:`/`chore:`/`ci:`/`test:`/`refactor:` alone → **no release**. Docs that ship in the npm
     tarball reach the registry with the next real release.
2. When a human decides it is time to release, fast-forward `release` to `main`:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git push origin origin/main:release   # fast-forward only; never force
   ```
   This is the release. It starts the workflow: the release check runs first, and semantic-release
   publishes only if every step passes.

   **For a major** (a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer since the last release), do not start here: follow
   *Promoting a major to `latest`* below, which puts a fresh pre-release on `next` first.
3. Watch the run under the repo's **Actions** tab.
4. **After a successful publish, bring the release commit back to `main`.** semantic-release commits
   the regenerated `CHANGELOG.md` + `package.json` + `package-lock.json` to the branch it ran on, so
   `release` is now one commit ahead. Until that commit reaches `main`, `main`'s version is behind npm
   and the next fast-forward (step 2) is refused as a non-fast-forward.

   Push it straight to `main`, with the same account that owns `RELEASE_TOKEN`:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git push origin origin/release:main
   ```

   **Not a pull request.** The `chore(release)` commit is authored by `semantic-release-bot` and is
   unsigned, and `yad-verified-commits` runs on every PR into any branch — so a sync-back PR is red by
   construction and could only be merged with an admin override. Pushing directly is the honest route.
   It works for an admin because `main`'s protection does not enforce its review rule on admins.

   If you do open one anyway, **merge it with a merge commit**. A squash or rebase rewrites that commit
   into a new SHA, `release` stops being an ancestor of `main`, and the next release's fast-forward
   breaks — the exact failure this step exists to prevent.

   The `[skip ci]` marker on the commit stops it from starting another release.

Run the same check locally before you decide, so a failure costs you a minute rather than a red
release:

```bash
npm run release-check
```

## The `next` channel — shipping a major without moving anyone onto it

A major changes the shape of the files in people's projects. Nobody should be carried onto that by an
ordinary `npm install`, and `yad migrate` should be proven on real projects before it is the only thing
standing between a user and their ledger. So a major goes to `next` first:

```bash
git fetch origin
git push origin origin/main:next     # publishes <major>.0.0-next.N to yadflow@next
```

While a major is on `next`, anyone on the current major keeps getting the current major. People who want
to try the new one opt in by name:

```bash
npm install yadflow@next -g
```

**Each pre-release needs the same sync-back as a stable one.** semantic-release commits
`chore(release): <major>.0.0-next.N` to `next`, so it is immediately one commit ahead of `main` and the next
`git push origin origin/main:next` is refused. Bring it back the same way as step 4 above:

```bash
git push origin origin/next:main
```

Do **not** force-push `next` instead. That orphans the commit the `v<major>.0.0-next.N` tag points at,
semantic-release then derives the same version again, and npm rejects the republish. Note that `main`'s
`package.json` will read `<major>.0.0-next.N` between the first pre-release and promotion; that is
correct, not drift.

### Promoting a major to `latest`

**What promotion publishes.** Fast-forwarding `release` publishes **`main`'s HEAD**, not the last
pre-release. semantic-release on `release` works out the version and the changelog from every commit
since the last stable release on that branch. So everything merged to `main` since the last pre-release
ships in the stable version too, even though nobody tried it on `next`.

**The rule:** cut a fresh `next` pre-release from `main` and prove it before fast-forwarding `release`.
"Prove it" means what the section above asks of any pre-release: the release check passes, and
`yad migrate` has been run on real projects with that exact version. Then promotion ships only what
`next` shipped, plus the release commit.

The order:

```bash
git fetch origin
git push origin origin/main:next       # 1. a fresh pre-release of main's HEAD
                                       # 2. prove that version on real projects
git fetch origin
git push origin origin/next:main       # 3. bring its release commit back to main
                                       # 4. merge ONE docs-only PR to main (see below)
git fetch origin
git push origin origin/main:release    # 5. promote: publishes <major>.0.0 to yadflow@latest
git fetch origin
git push origin origin/release:main    # 6. bring the stable release commit back to main
```

**Why step 4 exists — the `[skip ci]` trap.** After step 3, `main`'s newest commit is the pre-release's
`chore(release): … [skip ci]` commit. GitHub starts **no** push workflow when the newest pushed commit's
message holds `[skip ci]`, and `release.yml` has no manual trigger. So pushing that commit to `release`
moves the branch and publishes nothing — no run appears at all (this happened on the first try at
4.0.0). Step 4 puts an ordinary merge commit on top. Keep that PR to docs only (for example the release
notes for the major): anything else merged between steps 1 and 5 ships in the stable version without
having been tried on `next`. If the release push has already happened with no run, the fix is the
same — merge the docs PR, then push `main` to `release` again; it is a plain fast-forward.

**Keep every skip marker out of that PR's title and commit messages.** GitHub reads the whole message
of the newest pushed commit, and a merge commit's message carries the PR title. It skips on any of
`[skip ci]`, `[ci skip]`, `[no ci]`, `[skip actions]` and `[actions skip]`, and on a `skip-checks: true`
trailer — even when the marker is only quoted, as in a PR *about* the marker. The first fix for the 4.0.0
promotion was titled that way, so its merge started no run either. Check before pushing:

```bash
git log -1 --format=%B origin/main | grep -iE '\[(skip ci|ci skip|no ci|skip actions|actions skip)\]|skip-checks: *true' \
  && echo "main ends on a skip marker: merge another docs PR first"
```

**Then point `next` at the stable version.** semantic-release moves `latest` to the new version, but it
leaves the `next` dist-tag (npm's name for a channel) on the last pre-release. That is **older** than
`latest`, and it lacks everything that went into the stable version after it. Anyone who still types
`yadflow@next` would get the older build. So, once, with an npm login that can publish `yadflow`:

```bash
npm dist-tag add yadflow@<major>.0.0 next
npm view yadflow dist-tags             # latest and next now name the same version
```

(This is a manual step because trusted publishing works only inside CI; a local `npm` needs its own
login, and a 2FA code if the account uses one.)

**What the `next` branch does afterwards: nothing, until the next major.** Leave it where it is. Push it
again only when a new major needs a trial, the same way as above. Do not push it for ordinary
`feat:`/`fix:` work: with no breaking change on `main`, semantic-release on `next` would publish a
pre-release of a minor (such as `4.1.0-next.1`) to `yadflow@next`, which nobody asked for.

**The update banner does the other half.** On a **major** jump it tells a user on the older major to
preview the migration against their own project before upgrading (`cli/update-notice.mjs`). It names
`npx yadflow@<new version> migrate` rather than the installed `yad migrate`, and the distinction
matters: a migration list ships inside the engine that introduces it, so the copy already installed
knows only its own steps and would report "nothing would change" for every project. `npx` runs the new
engine without installing it, and a preview writes nothing either way.

Minor and patch upgrades say nothing about migrating, because everything below a major is additive by
policy — a note on every release is how the one that matters gets ignored.

## Verify

```bash
npx yadflow@latest --version   # the new version
npm view yadflow dist-tags      # latest: <version>
```

The npm package page shows a green **Provenance** badge linking back to the `release.yml` run.

## Troubleshooting

- **Release job fails at the npm step (`EINVALIDNPMTOKEN` / OIDC error):** the trusted publisher isn't
  registered for this package, or the workflow filename/repo in the npm config doesn't match. Re-check
  step B.
- **Publish rejected with `E422 … repository visibility: "private"`:** npm provenance only works for a
  **public** source repo. Make the repo public, or set `publishConfig.provenance: false` to publish
  without an attestation.
- **PR won't merge ("review required"):** `main` is branch-protected with a required review. Approve the
  PR, or admin-merge: `gh pr merge <n> --squash --admin`. This gate is separate from the release job's
  own `chore(release)` commit, which needs no bypass under today's rules (step D).
- **Release fails at the commit-back / `git push` step ("protected branch" / 403):** a rule on the
  publishing branch now refuses the push — today's rules (step E) only block deletion and force pushes,
  so check whether someone added one. If the rule should stay, `RELEASE_TOKEN` must exist, be unexpired,
  and belong to a user that rule lets through. Re-check steps D and E.
- **The release job failed at the npm step, but the tag and the `chore(release)` commit exist:** the
  publish-time test run failed, and that version is burned. See *The test suite runs a second time* under
  *How it works*: fix the cause on `main`, and push the branch again for the next number.
- **No release was cut after a merge to `main`:** expected — `main` never publishes. Only a
  fast-forward of `release` (or `next`) does.
- **No release was cut from `release`:** the commits since the last tag were all non-releasing types
  (`docs:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `test:`, `refactor:`). Only `feat`/`fix`/`perf`/`revert`/breaking trigger
  a version.
- **`git push origin origin/main:release` is rejected as non-fast-forward:** `release` carries a
  `chore(release)` commit from the last publish that `main` does not have. Bring that commit back to
  `main` first with an admin push, as in step 4 of *Cutting a release* (not a PR), then sync again.
- **Release job on `main` fails with `ERELEASEBRANCHES`:** the `release` branch is missing on origin.
  Recreate it at the last released commit: `git push origin <tag-commit>:refs/heads/release`.
- **A `2FA` prompt blocks automated publish:** it shouldn't — OIDC trusted publishing satisfies the
  publish requirement without an OTP. Only the one-time manual bootstrap (step A) prompts.
