# The release check — the gate a release has to clear before anything reaches npm.
#
# Rule 10 of the change-safety rules (docs/roadmap-idea-1.md, Part 8): a release is a human decision.
# A person decides by fast-forwarding `release` to `main`; this decides whether that decision is SAFE
# to carry out. Semantic-release runs only after this passes (.github/workflows/release.yml).
#
# It exists because the engine's file shapes are changing. A green unit suite proves the code works on
# the machine that wrote it. What a release needs to prove is different, and every step below is one
# way a user could be hurt by an upgrade:
#
#   1  tests + coverage    the ordinary bar, at the ordinary thresholds
#   2  the golden test     a real frozen v3 project still reads exactly as it did (rule 6)
#   3  migrate --preview   the upgrade path can be PLANNED on that project without touching it
#   4  fresh install       the tarball people actually download installs and sets a project up
#   5  doctor              that brand-new project is healthy by this release's own reckoning
#   6  migration guide     if the file shape moved, the page explaining it exists (rule 7)
#   7  gate-sync major     the CI fragments `yad update` wires trust the major this release publishes
#   8  toolbox vetting     every external tool yadflow names was vetted (licence + source) recently (E88)
#   9  lifecycle defaults  no lifecycle default an earlier release shipped has changed since (E134)
#
# Run it yourself before deciding: bash scripts/release-check.sh
