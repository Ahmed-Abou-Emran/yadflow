# verified-commits gate.
# Every commit in the range under review must carry a signature the PLATFORM marks as verified (the
# GitHub/GitLab "Verified" badge — proves the commit was signed by a key registered to the account that
# owns the author email). Unsigned commits do not reach merge — on the Product and on every connected
# repo alike.
#
# There is no author allowlist. It used to be `.sdlc/verified-authors`, generated from the Product
# roster's emails; yadflow removed the roster (E62) and keeps no list of people. Who may author a commit
# is who has write access to the repository — the platform's own answer, which never goes stale — and
# the signature proves which platform account made the commit. A `.sdlc/verified-authors` file an older
# release generated is no longer read, and the gate says so when it finds one.
#
# Merge-commit signature exemption: a merge that introduces NO content of its own (its combined diff
# is empty — no conflict-resolution / evil-merge hunks) is signature-waived, because every change it
# carries already lives in its individually signature-checked parents. This unblocks self-hosted
# GitLab, which does not sign UI-created merge commits (the signature API returns 404). A merge that
# DOES introduce content of its own still requires a verified signature (fail-closed).
#
# Degradation is explicit, never silent:
#   - no GitHub/GitLab remote  -> signature check SKIPPED with a warning (no platform, no badge)
#   - platform API unreachable -> FAIL closed (a security gate must not pass on a broken check)
#
# GitLab note: the signature API is not readable with CI_JOB_TOKEN — provide a CI variable
# GITLAB_TOKEN (or SDLC_API_TOKEN) with read_api scope; see the pipeline fragment header.
