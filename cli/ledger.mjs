// SAME epic both appended to the same file → git merge conflict on push. The fix ("loose objects +
// `git gc`"): each writer writes ONE small file per entry under a shard dir, so concurrent writers
// touch different files → zero conflict, by construction. Readers UNION the folded file (the legacy
// single file, and the output of `yad tidy up`) with every loose shard. `yad tidy up` folds finished
// shards back into the folded file on demand — a single, serialized, human-run act.
//
// A legacy epic that only has the folded file still reads correctly (no shards to union) → zero
// migration; new writes simply go to shards.
//
// Shards remove the conflict BETWEEN entries; they do not make a single read-modify-write atomic, so
// every writer that decides something from the ledger before writing takes an exclusive lock first
// (see "ledger locking" below).

// ---- ledger locking -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Shards make concurrent writers conflict-free ACROSS entries, but a writer that READS THEN WRITES is
// only safe if nothing slips in between. `writeRetroShip` decides "no ship for this (story, repo) yet"
// and then writes; `updateShip` finds a ship and then rewrites it; a fold reads shards, merges them,
// then deletes them. Two `--retro-ship` runs with different `--task` values both read "no ship", both
// write, and the duplicate guard is defeated — two shards for one (story, repo). So every
// read-modify-write on a ledger holds an exclusive lock for its whole span.
//
// `fs.mkdirSync` is the primitive: directory creation is atomic on POSIX and Windows, so exactly one
// caller wins and the rest get EEXIST. It needs no fd bookkeeping, releases with one `rmdir`, and an
// EMPTY DIRECTORY IS INVISIBLE TO GIT — a lock can never be committed, and `readShardDir` only reads
// `*.json` files, so it is never mistaken for an entry either.
//
// The lock is per LEDGER, not per (story, repo). A per-identity lock keyed on the raw identity would
// let the one pair that most needs serializing race: `api.v2` and `api_v2` are DIFFERENT identities
// that share ONE shard filename (`safe()` maps both to `api_v2`), so they would take different locks
// and then collide on the same file. A ledger-wide lock cannot be wrong that way, and what it
