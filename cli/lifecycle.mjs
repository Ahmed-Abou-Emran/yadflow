// The lifecycle definition — the phases, steps and routes as one versioned JSON file (E134, the first row
// of the lifecycle spine; docs/roadmap-idea-1.md, "The lifecycle spine").
//
// WHERE THE LIFECYCLE LIVES NOW. yadflow ships its default as `cli/lifecycle/defaults/<n>.json`. Until
// E134 the same facts were lists written in `cli/epic-state.mjs` (`STEPS`, `LIFECYCLE_PROFILES`,
// `PHASES`, `PRODUCT_PHASES`, the Build order). Those names still exist, with the same contents, but they
// are now VIEWS of the default, built by the functions at the bottom of this file. A test compares each
// view, field by field and in key order, with a frozen copy of the lists as they stood before this row
// (`cli/fixtures/lifecycle-v4-catalogue.json`), so the move changed nothing the engine does.
//
// WHAT IS NOT READ YET. Nothing reads a team's own file in this row: `.sdlc/lifecycle.json` is E135. The
// validator below (`lifecycleProblems`) and the behaviour registry are built and tested now so the file
// format is settled before anyone can write one. Several fields of a step (`behaviours`, `inputs`,
// `extraPaths`, `provider`, `replaces`) are checked by the validator now; the engine starts to act on
// them in later rows (E136, E141).
//
// A PAST DEFAULT NEVER CHANGES. A team's file will say which default it was copied from (`extends:
// "yadflow-default@<n>"`), and `yad lifecycle upgrade` (E141) compares the old default, the team's file
// and the new default. That only works if `1.json` stays exactly what it was on the day it shipped. A
// change to the default is a new file, `2.json`. The release check refuses a release that edits a
// default an earlier release carried (scripts/release-check.sh).
//
// IT IS JSON, NOT AN IMPORT. The file is read with `fs` rather than `import … with { type: 'json' }`,
// because the published package supports Node 18, where that import form is not stable on every release.

// YADFLOW'S CLAIMS: every step yadflow has ever shipped, by its original id (`provider.origin`), with the
// files it claims — its artifact (path and type) and the files it commits beside it (`extraPaths`, such as
// the contract beside the architecture). Read from the shipped defaults, so the rule cannot drift from the
// data; a test ties these files to what the engine itself commits for each step (`stepPaths`, cli/fold.mjs).
//
//   byOrigin  origin -> { type, path, version, extras } (`version`: the newest `provider.version`
//             shipped). A step that names a yadflow origin must name one of these (a step with no origin
//             is matched by its id), or the upgrade merge (E141), which matches yadflow's steps by origin, would have
//             nothing to match it to.
//   byKey     the key a review branch finds a file by (`artifactKey`) -> the origin that owns it. Once
//             yadflow ships a name it stays reserved for that step, even in a file that deleted the step:
//             the engine treats several of these names specially by name (`architecture` is hashed with
//             the contract lock, `discovery` is read back as the discovery set), so another step taking
//             one would be read the wrong way.
