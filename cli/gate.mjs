// about — and on a closed step it listed one person twice. `aliases` is the roster's own name → login

// older record is matched only when nothing else could be it: the same submission time on GitHub, or, on
// an OPEN step, the single unmatched approval against the single unmatched older approver of this PR on
// GitLab. A record an older release marked `unverified` names a login already and is never translated. Guessing by order is how two people's fingerprints got
// swapped. Where it stays ambiguous, a closed step adds nothing (its record is history, and a second
// entry for the same review would count one person twice), and an open step records the approval

// after the upgrade left an open review's older approvals matchable only when nothing else could be them.
//
// An older record is one an older release wrote with a `role` or `domain`, naming the person by the
// roster's `name`. It is stamped exactly as `upsertBridge` rewrites a record it continues: `approver` /
// `commenter` becomes the login, and `role`, `domain` and `unverified` are removed — a role left on a
// login-named record would make the next sync look its login up as a roster name, which can be another
// person's. The dated `reviews/*--approved.md` keeps the roles.
//
// It stamps only what the name table places for certain, and leaves the rest for `upsertBridge` to judge
// with the platform's evidence in hand:
//   - an `unverified` record already names a login, and a name two logins share (`clashed`) or a name the
//     roster does not hold is not in `aliases` — none is touched;
//   - ONE RECORD PER PERSON, BUT ONLY FOR ONE REVIEW. An older release wrote one record per role, so one
//     approval can be several records. Several records for one login on one step are merged only when they
//     provably are one review: every one holds the same submission TIME and the same `pr`. Anything less is
//     not proof — a GitLab record from before E64 holds the day it was synced, so two people a renamed
//     roster now gives one name, synced the same day, look identical; a hand-written record holds no time at
//     all. Merging those deleted one person's approval and passed a gate on the other's approval of old
//     content (E64 upgrade simulation). Such a group is left as it is (`unplaced`). When records for one
//     review disagree on the fingerprint, the stale one (outside `acceptedHashes`) is kept, as E62 does;
//   - a stamped approval keeps the roster name it had in `rosterName`. `upsertBridge` still lets an exact
//     submission time beat that name, as it did while the record carried a role — so a renamed shared name
//     stamped onto the wrong login is corrected by the platform's time, not locked in;
//   - a comment round where two records would name one login is left as it is: which count is right is
//     not knowable, and the cost of leaving it is one extra round.
// Pure: returns new arrays and the counts; `acceptedFor(artifact)` gives that artifact's live fingerprints.
