//   exists to prevent: the step advanced without the record that justifies it. It reads approvals the
//   way `gatePredicate` does (`status === 'approved'`, with `inherited`/`skipped` steps short-circuited
//   before it), so a step reported here is one the gate itself would refuse today. It is deliberately
//   deliberately the WEAKER question: it asks whether any qualifying approval RECORD exists, not whether
//   enough distinct people approved for the step's reported count (`gateRuleFor`, E7 — which holds no
//   gate and so has nothing to audit against). Zero approvals is the one state that was never legitimate
//   under any rule, and re-auditing a step that already passed against a number that arrived afterwards
//   would flood a healthy project with findings nobody can act on.
//
//   WARN — it holds approvals, but none still bind to the artifact as it stands. The gate is
//   deliberately one-way — nothing pulls a chain backward once work is built on it — so the only way
//   this surfaces is if something reports it. `gate sync` records the gap on the step it is syncing;
//   this reports it for the whole epic, so a re-locked surface that was never re-approved is visible
//   in the one command people run when something looks wrong. A warning, because the state is a fact

// two PR gates have the same gap for a Foundation section riding a non-review branch.

//   foundation:two     a Foundation AND an old `epics/EP-discovery/` ledger — fail. Two product levels

// somebody's file meant, which is exactly what a project runs `yad doctor` to avoid.
//
// `step:unknown-status` — a status no word in STEP_STATES names, and no legacy spelling either.
// This is NOT automatically a fault. A project may hold a step written by a NEWER yadflow, and for
// this whole major the file wins (the same rule as the step catalogue and the work-item type). What
// it costs is real and worth saying once: `stepStatus` fails closed on a word it cannot name, so
// every reader treats the step as neither passed nor authored — the chain stops there, and
// `yad next` will keep naming the step before it.
//
// `step:no-record` — a status that must say WHY and does not. Four of the eight states carry a
// record: `skipped`, `deferred`, `satisfied` and `blocked`. A skip with no reason is the thing the
// whole design refuses — "a recorded skip is not a hole in the audit trail, it IS the audit trail" —
// so a recorded state with nothing recorded on it is a hole wearing the shape of a record.
//
// TWO DELIBERATE NARROWINGS, and each of them is what keeps this check honest rather than noisy:
//
//  1. It reads the `status` FIELD literally, not `stepStatus`. The legacy encodings carry their own
//     provenance — a skipped step has `skipReason`/`skippedBy`/`skippedAt`, an inherited one has
//     `inheritedFrom`/`boundHash` — and for this major those ARE the record. Asking a pre-shape-7
//     project for a `record` it had no way to write would report every change-epic in the project,
//     including the frozen one the golden test pins.
//  2. A literal `blocked` is asked for a record only at shape 7 and above. Below it, `blocked` is the
//     old spelling of "not started" and there is nothing to explain. At shape 7 the stamper has
//     already rewritten those, so one that remains was hand-written — and it still READS as `todo`,
//     which is the surprising half and what the hint leads with.

// The shape in which `blocked` stopped meaning "not started". A FIXED historical number, not
// `SCHEMA_VERSION`: that one moves with every future shape change, and this fact does not.
