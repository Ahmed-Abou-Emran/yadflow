// ---- file shape (schemaVersion) -----------------------------------------
// Rule 1 of the change-safety rules (docs/roadmap-idea-1.md, Part 2): every file the engine writes
// states its shape, and a file with no version counts as 1.
//
// Both halves live here, in the one JSON reader/writer pair, rather than at the ~30 call sites. Two
// writers that disagreed about whether — or where — a file carries the stamp would flip its bytes back
// and forth on every sync, which is the ledger-churn failure issue #163 exists to prevent.
//
// Two conditions gate it, and both are load-bearing:
//
//   * the path runs through a `.sdlc` directory. writeJSON is also how the CLI writes
//     `.claude/settings.json` (cli/plan.mjs) and the per-user update cache (cli/update-notice.mjs).
//     Stamping a file the engine does not own would be a bug, not a feature.
//   * the value is a plain object. Four ledger kinds — approvals, comments, hub-prs and
//     reconcile-debt — are top-level JSON arrays, which cannot carry a key. Rule 1's second half
//     already covers them: no version means version 1. Wrapping them in an object would be a shape
//     change, and shape changes wait for v4 (rule 7).
// Matched against the file's own directory and its parent, NOT any ancestor. Every kind the engine
// writes sits either directly in a `.sdlc/` (state.json, hub.json, …) or one level down in a shard
// folder (build-log/, trust-log/, build-state/). Matching any ancestor instead would stamp every JSON
// file in a project that merely happened to live somewhere under a directory called `.sdlc` — the
// user's own .claude/settings.json included, which is exactly what this must never touch. A new kind
// nested deeper than that has to be added here on purpose.
// Exported so the dial stampers (migrate.mjs, epic-state.mjs) and doctor all decide "is this a step
// object" the same way. Three private copies drifted once already: one guarded arrays, one did not,
// so an array-valued step came out as `["x"]` from one and `{"0":"x"}` from the other.

// Always FIRST in the serialized object. A stamp that moved around between writers would change the
// bytes without changing the meaning. An existing version is preserved, never forced back or forward,
// so a file already on another shape survives being read and written by this release.
//
// Reading and writing do NOT default the same way, and the difference is load-bearing:
//
//   read  — a file with no version IS shape 1 (rule 1). Defaulting it to the engine's current shape
//           would be the engine telling itself an old file is already current. Everything downstream
//           believes it: `yad doctor` stops reporting drift, and a plain read-modify-write stamps the
//           engine's shape onto content that was never migrated — after which `yad migrate` skips the
//           file forever, because its own claim says there is nothing to do. Silent, permanent, and
//           invisible until someone asks why a field never got renamed.
//   write — a NEW object, one that was never read from disk and so has no version of its own, is
//           written by this engine and therefore has this engine's shape.
