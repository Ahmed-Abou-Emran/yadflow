// `yad hook ledger-guard` — the harness-side half of the ledger rule (#171).
//
// In verified mode the gate ledger is CI-owned: `templates/checks/ledger-guard.sh` rejects any non-bot
// commit that changes `epics/*/.sdlc/{state,approvals,comments,product-prs,hub-prs}.json` or `epics/*/reviews/*.md`.
// That gate is the authority, but it only speaks at CI time — an agent that hand-edits `state.json`
// learns twenty minutes later, from a failed pipeline with nothing connecting cause to effect. This
// hook says the same thing at the moment of the edit, and names the command that owns the transition.
//
// HARNESS-AGNOSTIC CONTRACT — the reason this is a `yad` subcommand and not Claude-Code-shaped code:
//   stdin   a harness tool-call payload as JSON (optional; `--path <p>` works instead)
//   exit 0  allow
//   exit 2  deny — the reason is on stderr, for the agent to read
// Claude Code's `PreToolUse` protocol is exactly that — exit 2 blocks the call and feeds stderr back
// to the model — so `hooks/ledger-guard.mjs` wires it with no adapter logic.
//
// Cursor's `preToolUse` is NOT that. It is a permission hook: it wants a JSON verdict on stdout and
// treats an empty or off-schema answer as a refusal, so the contract above would block every write.
// `--format cursor` below answers in that protocol instead, and `hooks/ledger-guard-cursor.mjs` is
// what Cursor's entry points at. Check which kind a harness is before wiring a new one.
//
// FAIL-OPEN, deliberately. No Product, unreadable config, an unparseable payload, no git — every one of
// those ALLOWS, with a note on stderr. This is a local guardrail, and one that failed closed would
// brick an agent's ability to edit anything the moment a config went sideways. The asymmetry is the
// design: `ledger-guard` in CI fails closed and is what actually protects the ledger.

// THE SHAPE RULE EXISTS BECAUSE THE SECOND HARNESS DOES NOT DOCUMENT ITS KEYS (E11). Cursor publishes
// the payload envelope — `tool_name`, `tool_input`, `cwd` — but not what `tool_input` is called
// inside for Write, Edit or Delete. Inventing a name from memory would produce the worst outcome this
// hook has: an entry wired, reported healthy by `yad doctor`, reading a key that does not exist,
// finding no path, and allowing every ledger edit. So instead of guessing a vendor's spelling, any
// key whose NAME ends in `path`, `file`, `paths` or `files` (in snake_case or camelCase) is read as
// one — a structural rule, which `target_file`, `filePath` and `file_path` all satisfy without this
// code having to know which harness sent them.
//
// It matches on the KEY, never on the value. A rule that scanned `tool_input`'s values for anything
// shaped like `epics/…/state.json` would refuse an ordinary edit to a document that merely QUOTES a
// ledger path — and a false deny is far worse here than a miss, because the whole design fails open
// on purpose and CI is what fails closed.
//
// An unrecognised payload still yields nothing, which allows — see the fail-open note above.
// A key is path-shaped when one of its WORDS is. Splitting on `_` and on camelCase humps is what
// makes `target_file`, `filePath`, `notebook_path` and `dest_path` all match while `profile` does not
// — `profile` is one word, and that word is not in the set. Matching a bare suffix instead would

// The same rule as the harness hook, asked by git instead of by an agent: `yad hook ledger-guard
// --staged` reads the files the commit is about to record and refuses the commit when one of them is a
// CI-owned file the `ledger-guard` check in CI would refuse. It catches a PERSON's hand commit, which the
// harness hook never sees. Installed per clone by `yad check --fix` as `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (see
// `gitHookActions` in plan.mjs); verified mode only, exactly like the harness hook.
//
// PARITY WITH THE CI CHECK is the whole claim, so each rule below is one the CI script already has:
//   - A MERGE commit passes. CI lists a commit's files with `git diff-tree`, which prints nothing for a
//     merge, so CI never judges one. Without this, a `git pull` that merges the bot's ledger commits
//     into a person's branch would be refused here while CI accepts it.
//   - The yad-gate-sync BOT passes, matched the way CI's `trusted_bot` matches it (the name or email
//     holds `yad-gate-sync`). CI then also checks the platform-Verified signature, which only the
//     platform can answer — a commit that claims the name without it still fails there.
//   - A DELETION counts: CI fails a deleted `state.json` (delete-then-re-seed would reset the carve-out).
//   - A RENAME is two paths, the old and the new (`--no-renames`), as E114 settled for every changed list.
// Known limit: `git commit --amend` is judged by what it changes against the commit it replaces — git does
// not tell a pre-commit hook it is an amend. So amending a commit that ALREADY changed the ledger passes
// here, and amending one to UNDO that change is refused; the message names the way through for the second.
// The pull request's check judges both correctly.

// HOW A HARNESS IS TOLD THE VERDICT. Two protocols, because the second harness does not accept the
// first (E11).
//
// `exit` is the original and the default: exit 0 allows, exit 2 denies, the reason goes to stderr for
// the model to read. Claude Code reads exactly that.
//
// `cursor` is for a harness whose PERMISSION hooks are answered in JSON on stdout. Cursor's docs are
// explicit that for a permission hook — and `preToolUse` is one — "invalid JSON or a response that
// doesn't match the hook's schema blocks the action". Printing nothing, which is what `exit` does on
// an allow, is invalid JSON. So the exit protocol under Cursor would have blocked EVERY file write in
// a verified project: fail-CLOSED on everything, the one outcome this guard's whole design forbids.
//
// WHAT THE REASON IS FOR, since three decisions below turn on it. A block alone is what CI already
// delivers, twenty minutes later. The only thing this hook adds is the sentence naming `yad gate
// open` at the moment of the edit — so a choice that keeps the block but loses the sentence has given
// up everything the hook was built for, while still passing any test that asks whether a deny denies.
//
// 1. THE FIELD NAMES are Cursor's documented permission-hook schema: `permission`, `user_message`,
//    `agent_message`, all snake_case. An off-schema response still BLOCKS, so a camelCase field would
//    refuse the write and discard the sentence, silently.
// 2. A DENY EXITS 0, not 2. The JSON is the authoritative answer and exit 0 is what tells Cursor to
//    read it; exit 2 blocks too, but is documented as the code for "no JSON to read". The reason also
//    goes to stderr, where Cursor logs it, so it is never only in a channel we cannot confirm.
// 3. THE ALLOW RESPONSE is a fixed literal with nothing interpolated into it, because a malformed
//    allow is a block. The deny response does carry text, and if a field there were ever rejected as
//    off-schema the response is invalid — which blocks, which is what a deny wanted anyway. Both
//    failure directions are safe, in opposite ways, on purpose.

// names the command rather than just refusing.

// The `yad hook ledger-guard` entry point. `paths` (from `--path`) is additive to the payload, so

// Tool names that cannot write a file, in either harness's vocabulary. A call naming one of these is
// allowed without being judged.
//
// AN ALLOWLIST OF READS, never a check that the tool IS a write, and the asymmetry is the point: a
// harness this code has never heard of sends a tool name nobody here recognises, and that call must
// still be judged. Recognising only known writers would wave it straight through.
//
// It exists because the write/read distinction otherwise lives entirely in the `matcher` inside the
// team's settings file — which the merge deliberately refuses to correct, and which both harnesses
// document `""` and `*` as widening to everything. A team that widens it gets a refusal on every READ
// of `state.json`, which `yad status` and the review-gate skill do routinely, and which an agent has
// to do to obey the deny message it was just handed. The code's own stance is that a false deny is
