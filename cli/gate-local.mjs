// `yad gate approve|comment|advance` (E112) — the review gate on a Product with NO platform.
//
// With a platform, the PR/MR is the review: `yad gate sync` reads its approvals and threads into the file
// ledger and advances the step on the merge. With no platform there is nothing to read, so `gate sync` and
// `gate ci` return at once — and the `yad-review-gate` skill used to append approvals and comments by hand
// and advance the chain by following a hand-written copy of `advanceState`. These three verbs are that path
// in the engine. The decisions were the user's (2026-09-24):
//   1. TWO human acts, as on a platform: a reviewer records an approval (`approve`, which only reports the
//      verdict), and someone then advances the step (`advance`, which runs the predicate). Approving never
//      advances, the way approving a PR never merges it.
//   2. NO PLATFORM ONLY. With a platform the approvals come from the PR/MR, and on a verified ledger CI is the
//      only writer — two sources of truth for one gate is the thing this refuses.
//   3. An approval records the artifact's fingerprint (`artifactHash`), so an edit after it revokes it, as a
//      platform approval is revoked. An older hand-written record with no fingerprint still counts.
//   4. `comment` records who took part (`comments.json`); the words stay in `reviews/*--comments.md`, which
//      the skill writes. With no platform there are no threads, so a comment never holds the gate.
// None of this stops a git merge conflict on the ledger: the writers upsert (one record per person) and sort,
// so equal content gives equal bytes, and after a conflict a person keeps either side and runs the verb again.
