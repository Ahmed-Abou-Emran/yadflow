// ---- the per-step gate rule (E7) -----------------------------------------------------------------
//
// HOW MANY HUMAN APPROVALS a step asks for, as a NUMBER derived from the step's own recorded data.
// `needed = base + risk step` — the roadmap's tier-1 rule (docs/roadmap-idea-1.md, Part 3). There is
// no name and no role anywhere in it, which is the whole point: a rule that names a person, a role or
// a step goes stale the moment the team changes, and "repository access is the roster" replaces it.
//
// WHAT HOLDS THE GATE. Part 3's rule is ONE formula: `needed = base + risk_step`, CAPPED at
// `active − 1`, floor 1 in team mode. `active` is the live count of people (E71, cli/people.mjs), read
// once per command by the caller. E72 computes the cap (`gateCapFor` below), prints it wherever a gate
// reports itself and records it on the closing record — but ONLY THE BASE HOLDS THE GATE, still.
//
// WHY THE CAP IS SHOWN AND NOT ENFORCED (the user's decision, 2026-09-21, after review). The count of
// people errs HIGH on purpose (E71), and in the NORMAL case, not an edge: a commit is keyed by its git
// NAME unless its address is a platform `noreply` one, an approval by its platform LOGIN, and E71 never
// joins the two without exact evidence. So a two-person team whose members commit with work addresses
// and approve on GitHub reads as FOUR, the cap lowers nothing, and an enforced contract gate would ask
// for three approvals from one person who is not the author — E7's deadlock, back. Rule 7 needs a way
// out before any count holds a gate, and that is `yad gate lower --reason`. E73 was to turn the capped
// count on together with it; the user then kept E73 to DETECTION (2026-09-22, `gateReach` below), and
// enforcement plus the escape hatch moved to E108, which waits for the count to be accurate. Until then
// `short` is measured against the capped ask and printed, and never enforced.
//
// WHEN THE COUNT IS UNKNOWN (`active: null`) no cap is computed at all: an unknown is never a small
// number (E71). Product CI is usually that case — it checks out only the Product, so connected repos are
// not on disk — and the surfaces say so.
//
// Until E62 the base was not what held a gate either: a ROLE rule read from the roster did (1 owner,
// 1 reviewer, a domain owner per touched repo). E62 removed the roster, and the base took its place.
//
// THE RISK STEP comes from the step's risk tags — `contract` +2, `auth` / `payments` +1 (the "high"
// tier), nothing +0. Two inferences the roadmap leaves open, recorded here so the next reader does not
// have to guess: `auth` and `payments` ARE the high tier (they are the other two escalators, and the
// roadmap gives the contract surface its own larger step), and a step carrying several tags takes the
// MAXIMUM step, never the sum — a gate is one decision about the riskiest thing it touches, and summing
// would let three tags ask for five approvals that no small team can produce.
//
// THE TAGS ARE READ FROM THE EPIC, not from the catalogue: `seedState` copies `risk_tags` into
// `state.json`, and a team may add `auth` to a step by hand. Change-safety rule 3 — the file wins — so
// the rule asks the step in front of it, exactly as `optionalStepsFor` asks the epic's recorded route.
//
// THE BASE IS 1: one human who is not the author. That is what Part 3 says the gate actually needs
// ("did a human approve; was it someone other than the author; were there enough of them"), and the
// platform already enforces the "not the author" half — on GitHub you cannot approve your own PR. The
// roadmap never fixes the number; E62 enforced it as the floor, and the cap (E72) never goes below it.
const GATE_BASE = 1;
// Tag -> { step, tier }. The TIER NAME comes from the winning tag rather than from the number, so a
// future change to a tag's step cannot make an `auth`-only gate print "contract risk".

// says why. Pure, data-only, and safe on a step from a newer yadflow — an unknown tag adds nothing, and

// than crashing the gate that was about to report on it.

//
//     to = min(needed, max(1, active − 1))        — never below the base, which is 1
//
// `active` is the capacity count from `activePeople` (cli/people.mjs). Anything that is not a whole
// number — `null` when a source could not be read, or a caller that has no count — gives NO cap (`null`):
// the cap is never applied from an unknown, so the risk step stays advisory and only the base holds.
//
// THE `− 1` IS ONE SEAT, NOT A CHECK. It leaves room for the author, who wrote the review branch in the
// Product and so is always among the people counted. The engine does not know who the author is and does
// not check whose approval it is counting: that is the PLATFORM's rule (E62 decision h — GitHub never
// allows self-approval; GitLab only when its settings say so; a local ledger checks nothing).
//
// The floor of 1 means the cap can only ever trim the RISK STEP. The base is 1, so `to` is at least the
// base. Until E108 the cap is REPORTED: the base alone holds every team gate (see `gateRuleFor`).
//
// Shape: { active, limit, to, capped } — `limit` is `max(1, active − 1)`, `to` the number asked for,

//
// TWO KINDS OF LINE, because two different things can be said, and mixing them made lines untrue:
//   `may not be met: …`                    TODAY's rule — the base, one approval — may have nobody to
//                                          give it.
//   `if the risk step were enforced: …`    a WHAT-IF — what enforcing more than the base would do. Today
//                                          the gate still passes on the base, and the line says so.
//
// Every claim is about the PEOPLE COUNTED, and is hedged ("may", "if"), because the count is wrong both
// ways, and neither is an edge:
//   too LOW   a reviewer who has not committed or approved inside the counting window is not counted —
//             the second person on a brand-new Product reads as absent until their first approval;
//   too HIGH  a commit is keyed by its git name and an approval by its platform login, and E71 never joins
//             the two without exact evidence, so a two-person team can read as four (E72, case a).
//
// WHAT AN APPROVAL SHOWS. `have` is the approvals on THIS step and `approvers` the people counted with an
// approval in the counting window. Any such approval shows that approvals can be given here, so the two
// TODAY lines speak only when there is none in the window. For the what-if lines an approval is also a
// lower bound on the team: the approvers on this step plus the author (`have + 1`), and at least two
// people once anyone approved anything. That assumes the platform keeps authors from approving their own
// work: always on GitHub, on GitLab only when its settings say so, never on a local ledger (E62 decision
// h). Where it is wrong the bound is too high, so a what-if line may stay quiet — never a false alarm.
//
// The checks, each only while its own ask is unmet:
//   base        0 or 1 active person counted, and no approval in the window.
//   one person  exactly two people counted, one NOT MATCHED to a login (a git name, or an approval record
//               that proves no login — an older hand-written one, or an engineer-review record, which
//               carries none) and one login, and no approval in the window: they may be one person. (A solo
//               developer who commits with a work address AND through GitHub's web editor, whose noreply
//               address carries the login, reads as two people; only this check sees it.)
//   full        (what-if) the cap lowered the ask: the full count is more than the people counted can
//               give. Not said when a today line is, nor when the approvals show more people than counted.
//   names       (what-if) some people are not matched to a login and at least one is a login, and the
//               smallest possible team cannot give the ask. That team is the larger of the logins and the
//               names (each name may be one of the logins, and distinct names are taken as distinct
//               people, as the count takes them), and never fewer than the approvals prove. Taking only the
//               logins made a four-person team with one web-editor commit read as "as small as 1".
// "No approval" always names the capacity window (`days`): the reader never sees an older approval.
// A Product whose records are all names (no platform) gets no name line — there is no login for a name
// to be the same person as. Two spellings of one NAME still count twice; that is E108's, with the join.
//
// An unknown count (`cap: null`) or an unknown `nameOnly` says nothing: an unknown is never a number.
// Pure. The caller decides where it applies — never in solo mode, never on a step that passed or was
// waived — and prints each distinct line once per command (`uniqueReach`).
// The SMALLEST POSSIBLE TEAM behind a count: the larger of the logins and the names not matched to a
// login (each name may be a second row for one of the logins), and never fewer than `floor`, the people

// filtered out of the array and pushed back at the TAIL. That makes the file's bytes depend on WHICH
// step was synced last, not on what the ledger holds — and the wired sweep drives one `gate ci` per
// merged PR/MR, so a pass over N merged reviews ROTATES the array:
//
//   [A,B,C,D,E] -sync A-> [B,C,D,E,A] -sync B-> [C,D,E,A,B] -> … -sync E-> [A,B,C,D,E]

// started — an unbounded commit loop with zero semantic change (issue #163). Sorting the array on
// write makes the bytes a pure function of the record SET, so an unchanged re-sync is byte-identical
// and `gate ci`'s existing "nothing staged -> nothing to commit" guard finally holds.
//
// The per-record JSON.stringify tiebreak is what makes the order TOTAL. `Array#sort` is stable, so
// records tying on the tuple key would keep their (rotating) insertion order — and a manual,
// skill-written approval can tie with a bridge one on (step, approver, role, domain). The tiebreak is
// position-independent, so ties resolve by content instead.
//
// Compared by CODE UNIT (`<`), not localeCompare: the ledger is written by CI and read/re-written by

// `yad doctor` warned, and the sweep said the rule no longer held, on every epic, right after a clean
// merge. The contract surface already hashed only what was reviewed; this does the same for the rest.
//
// The block is found with the regex `setFrontmatterStatus` uses, shared from here, so the line the

// ---- the step-state model (E38) -------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// WHAT A STEP'S `status` MEANS, in one table, for the first time. Until now the answer was four words
// hard-coded in about thirty places with two boolean flags beside them, and every reader decided for
// itself what each one implied.
//
// The roadmap's model (docs/roadmap-idea-1.md, Part 1, "Step states") names SEVEN states. The table
// below has EIGHT rows, because `in_review` is kept beside them (see the note at the end of this
// comment). The two questions those thirty readers were really asking are its two columns:
//
//   passed    may the chain continue past this step, and does a later step see it as satisfied?
//   authored  was the artifact actually WRITTEN HERE? (a skip and an inheritance are not)
//
// Those are not one question, and running them together is the bug this table exists to stop. Both
// used to be spelled `status === 'done'`, which is why a skipped step had to be pre-marked `done` to
// get past the first group and carry a flag to be excluded from the second. Which reader wants which:
//
//   isPassed     `preconditionsMet`'s blocker scan · `restoreStep`'s `priorAllDone` ·
//                `closeAuthorStep`'s "already finished" guard (stamping `done` over a SKIPPED author
//                step would destroy the provenance of the skip) · `gate sync`'s `alreadyDone` ·
//                `buildNextForRepo`'s active-step scan · `artifact-status`'s "approved"
//   isAuthored   `setAsideStep`'s "already authored" refusal
//   == 'done'    `stateInvariants` on the REVIEW side and `yad doctor`'s gate-blind check — both ask
//                "did this gate genuinely complete here", which `isAuthored` answers for an author
//                step and this answers for a gate
//   set aside    the three step-over scans (`advanceState`, `setAsideStep`, `restoreStep`) walk past a
//                step whose STATUS is `skipped` or `deferred` (`isSetAside`, E37). They read the status,
//                never a legacy flag alone, so `skipped: true` on an unfinished step is not walked past.
//                A status word typed by hand onto a required step IS walked past, as a hand-typed
//                `skipped` always was: the file wins, and `yad doctor` reports it (`skip:not-optional`)
//
// A THIRD QUESTION, and it is not either column: what the file CLAIMS about itself. `claimsSkipped` /
// `claimsInherited` below answer that, for the readers that apply their own guard to the claim.
//
// THE NAME COLLISION THIS TASK HAD TO SETTLE. Every release up to shape 6 wrote `blocked` to mean
// "waiting on an earlier step" — which is what the roadmap calls `todo`. The roadmap gives `blocked` a
// DIFFERENT meaning: cannot proceed, and not by our choice. One string, two meanings.
//
// The disambiguator is the RECORD, not the schema version:
//
//     `blocked` + no `record`  ==  todo     — everything written before shape 7
//     `blocked` + a `record`   ==  blocked  — genuinely stuck; the record says on whom or what
//
// That is unambiguous BY CONSTRUCTION, because no release has ever written a `record`. Keying it on
// `schemaVersion` instead was the obvious alternative and is worse: `yad migrate` never rewrites
// `state.json` on a VERIFIED project — CI is its only writer, so the file is reported `ci-owned` and
// skipped — which leaves such a project at shape 6 until its next gate write, and several readers
// (`cli/doctor.mjs`, `cli/artifact-status.mjs`) load the file raw and have no shape number in hand.
// A meaning that depends on a number in another key is also a meaning a hand-edit can flip.
//
// Shape 7 writes `todo` going forward, and `blocked`-with-no-record stays READ as `todo` for this
// whole major — rule 2, read old and write new.
//
// THE CONVERSE: clearing a `blocked` must move `status` OFF `blocked`. Deleting only the record turns the
// step silently back into a `todo`. `unblockStep` (`yad unblock`, E37) is that verb, and it does both in
// one write.
//
// `in_review` is not in the roadmap's table and stays on purpose. It is `in_progress` on a
// `review+approve` step, and `markInReview`, `advanceState` and `cli/artifact-status.mjs` all key on
// that difference — an artifact whose gate is open reads `in-review`, one still being written reads
// `draft`. The table's `in-progress` hyphen is prose: the hyphen appears nowhere in code and in no
// file on disk, where the word has always been `in_progress`.
//
// WHO WRITES THE RECORDED STATES. `yad skip` writes `skipped` (E35, E36) and `yad defer` writes
// `deferred` (E37), both THROUGH this table rather than beside it. Nothing in the CLI writes `blocked`:
// a person does, by hand, and the `yad-run` skill does for a halted Build lane. `yad unblock` clears one
// (E37). `cli/test.mjs` still constructs a chain carrying every row of this table and pins each reader
// against it, because a state the fixtures happen not to use is untested.
//
// `debt: true` (E41) is a FLAG BESIDE a state, not a ninth row: it changes nothing any column above
// answers. `yad defer --debt` writes it on a deferred pair — work the team set aside under pressure and
// owes back — and it only decides what REMINDS (`owedSteps`: `yad next`, `yad doctor`). It stays on the
// pair while the step is paid back, and `advanceState` removes it when the step's review passes.

//
// THE PAIRING IS LOAD-BEARING, and a first cut of this function got it wrong by reading the flag
// alone. Both writers have always stamped the flag AND pre-marked the step `done`, and it is the

// finished step would let `skipped: true`, typed into a file by someone with no route permission to

//
// BOTH FLAGS ARE STILL WRITTEN as well as read — rule 3, add before you remove — so a 3.x reader
// keying on `.skipped` or `.inherited` keeps working for this whole major.

//   * top-level `kind` in state.json is the lifecycle marker `"stub"` / `"discovery"`. A stub epic
//     legitimately carries `kind: "stub"` AND `type: "feature"` at once.
//   * `steps[].type` is `author` / `review+approve` — which kind of STEP, not which kind of work.
//
// Add-only, and idempotent, so a second `yad migrate` and every later gate write are no-ops:
//   * a state that already records a `type` is returned untouched, whatever it says;
//   * so is one whose epic has no `epic.md` to read a type from. That is the discovery front-zero
//     (`EP-discovery`, `kind: "discovery"`), which is not a work item on the ladder and has no
//     frontmatter to copy. Inventing `feature` for it would put a fifth thing on the ladder that
//     nobody authored.
//
// ONE of these, called from `writeState` below and from the 4 -> 5 step in cli/migrate.mjs. E28
// shipped two dial stampers and they drifted — one guarded array-valued steps, the other did not.
export function stampWorkItemType(state, epicDir) {
  // ANY `type` key already present is left alone, not just a string one. Overwriting a value
  // somebody wrote — even `null`, even a number — would be this function deciding what their file

  // understand; silently correcting one is the behaviour the whole shape-5 design refuses.

  // Placed at the TOP of the file, not appended. `{ ...state, type }` is the one-line version and it
  // puts the key last, which on a real state.json means `"type": "feature"` dangling at the bottom
  // directly beneath a `steps` array whose every entry carries its own `"type"` — the exact two-axis
  // confusion the rest of this change exists to prevent. JSON key order IS the file's bytes, so the
  // object is rebuilt in order rather than spread and assigned.
  //
  // Idempotent either way: a state that already records a type returns above, keeping the position it
  // has, so a file seeded by a skill is never reordered by a later engine write.
  //
  // `profile` is in the anchor list, and that is what makes the canonical order `type, profile`
  // unconditional rather than a happy accident of the order `writeState` calls the two stampers in.
  // The migration chain adds `type` at 4 -> 5 and `profile` at 5 -> 6, so it always produces that
  // order. A gate write does not always have both to add at the same moment: an epic whose ledger
  // reached shape 5 before its `epic.md` existed (seeded by `yad-analysis`, migrated during the
  // upgrade, the epic authored afterwards) gets `profile` from the migration and `type` only from a
  // LATER gate write. Without this anchor that write would append `type` after `profile`, and a
  // verified project would hold a key order no local project can produce.

// Record which lifecycle profile the chain came from. Shape 6.
//
// A PROFILE is the route an epic takes through the lifecycle — the named, ordered chain of catalogue
// steps E5 wrote down. Until now nothing on disk said which one an epic was on, and every reader
// worked it out by matching the chain. That is a fine answer for a report and a bad one for a seed:
// `yad epic new` has to know the route BEFORE there is a chain to match, and an epic that legitimately
// dropped steps reads as a shorter route than the one it was started on.
//
// DERIVED, NEVER DEFAULTED, for an epic that already exists. The value comes from
// `matchLifecycleProfile`, which returns null for a chain that fits no route — and a null means NO
// KEY, not `classic`. Stamping a guess would put a route on the record that nobody chose, and
// `yad doctor` would then stop reporting the chain as off-route because the file would finally agree
// with itself. `yad doctor` reports the gap; an upgrade never invents an answer for it.
//
// Add-only and idempotent, exactly like `stampWorkItemType`: ANY `profile` key already present is
// left alone, whatever it says. A project may carry a route from a newer yadflow, and a hand-written
// chain is allowed to be ahead of the tool reading it (rule 3 — the file wins for this whole major).
//
// ONE of these, called from `writeState` below and from the 5 -> 6 step in cli/migrate.mjs, because
// on a VERIFIED Product `yad migrate` never rewrites `state.json` — CI is its only writer, so the
// gate's own write is the only path a shape change has into that file.
//
// MATCHED AGAINST A FROZEN ROUTE SET, not against `LIFECYCLE_PROFILES`. A migration answers a question
// about the PAST — "which of the routes that existed when shape 6 landed is this chain on" — and
// reading the live table lets a route added later change that answer.
//
// `matchLifecycleProfile` breaks ties on the SHORTEST fitting route, and E40 adds two routes shorter
// than `classic`. Every chain drawn only from `epic`, `epic-review`, `stories` and `stories-review`
// therefore changes route the day the chore lane lands: a chain that stops at `epic-review`, or one
// hand-edited down to those steps, is the shape this catches. Against the live table an upgrade would
// relabel such an epic, and `optionalStepsFor` would answer from the new route for good, because the
// key just written is the one every later reader prefers over matching.
//
// NO SEED yadflow HAS EVER SHIPPED IS AFFECTED — every one of them carries `architecture`, which no
// short lane has, so a seeded chain still matches `classic` either way. HAND-WRITTEN CHAINS ARE, and
// this repo holds two: the `EP-e2e` and `EP-cici` fixtures in test/e2e/run.sh are `[epic, epic-review]`
// with no `profile` key, which the live table now places on `chore`. `yad gate ci` stamps them through
// `writeState`, so they are a live exercise of this function, and without the freeze they would come
// out labelled `chore`. Rule 3 is the general form of the same point: a hand-written chain is allowed
// to be ahead of the tool reading it, and a migration that is correct only because of what today's
// data happens to contain is one release away from being wrong.
//
// The freeze pins the SET OF ROUTES shape 6 may choose from, not the step rows inside them. Editing
// `classic`'s own chain would still move what fits it. That is the right scope — a route's steps are
// its definition, and a migration reading a stale copy of them would be the drift this file spends
// most of its comments avoiding — but it means the guarantee is against ADDED routes, not all change.
//
// `shape6Routes()` is the freeze and `profiles` is the seam the tests drive it through. Epics seeded
// by `yad epic new` are unaffected either way: `seedState` writes `profile` itself, and the first line
// here leaves any key already present alone — so a chore-lane epic keeps its own route.
//
// The freeze is about STAMPING, not about reading. An epic whose chain genuinely is chore-shaped and
// which carries no key gets `classic` here, and `yad doctor` then reports `profile:disagree` against
// the live table. That is the right split: an upgrade records what was true, and the report is what
// tells a person the label wants correcting. The remedy is to set `profile` by hand, once.

  // rebuilt in order rather than spread and assigned.
  //
  // No trailing "if it still is not there, append it" guard, unlike `stampWorkItemType`. That guard is
  // reachable there because that stamper runs on states with no `steps` at all; here a profile is only

  // arm has already placed the key. A line that cannot run is a line no test can cover.

// Move a `state.json`'s recorded shape up to this engine's, AFTER both stampers above have run.
//
// This is the other half of the verified-mode gap, and without it the first half is a half-truth.
// On a verified Product `yad migrate` reports `state.json` as `ci-owned` and never writes it, so the
// stampers are what carry a shape change into that file. They carried the FIELDS. They did not carry
// the NUMBER, because `writeShape` (cli/lib.mjs) preserves a stamp that is already there — the right
// rule for every other caller, and the wrong one for the one file no migration will ever reach.
//
// The effect was permanent and silent. yadflow 3.18.1 stamps `schemaVersion: 1`, so every verified
// project on disk today holds a `state.json` recording shape 1. Its fields would be brought fully up
// to date by the next gate write while the number stayed at 1 for ever, and `yad doctor` would keep
// reporting "N are CI-owned and behind" with the hint "CI owns these files and moves them on its next
// gate sync" — a warning that could never clear, attached to a sentence that was not true.
//
// WHAT MAKES THIS CORRECT is an invariant, not an assumption: for `state.json`, running the whole
// migration chain must produce exactly what these stampers produce — in the same ORDER, down to the
// bytes. Two things hold that up and both are load-bearing. The stampers are called here in the
// migration's own order (dials, type, profile), and each inserts its key in front of every key a LATER
// shape adds, so a gate write that supplies one of them long after the other still lands it in the
// canonical position. Without the second, a ledger that reached shape 5 before its `epic.md` existed
// would come out `profile, type` while every migrated project reads `type, profile`. It holds today — shapes 2 and 3
// change `hub.json` and the roster, shape 4 is the dials (`stampStepDials`), shape 5 is the work-item
// type (`stampWorkItemType`). cli/test-migrate.mjs pins it by migrating one project, gate-writing
// another, and comparing the two files byte for byte. A future shape that changes `state.json`
// without adding a stamper here fails that test loudly rather than mis-stamping a file quietly.
//
// Never DOWN. A file recording a shape newer than this engine understands is left exactly as it is:
// `yad migrate` reports that one `ahead` and refuses it for the same reason, and lowering the number
// would have this release claim it wrote something it cannot read.

// Move every step's `status` onto the step-state model. Shape 7 (E38).
//
// Three rewrites, and every one is a TRANSLATION of something the file already said — never a new
// fact, which is the same discipline as the dial stamp above and the type/profile copies below:
//
//   `blocked` with no `record`  ->  `todo`       `blocked` changes meaning in shape 7, so the old
//                                                spelling of "not started" is written out here, while
//                                                the file still says it unambiguously.
//   `skipped: true`             ->  `skipped`    the step's own state, with a `record` assembled from
//                                                the `skipReason` / `skippedBy` / `skippedAt` the
//                                                skip already recorded. Nothing is invented.
//   `inherited: true`           ->  `satisfied`  done elsewhere: the artifact is carried by reference
//                                                and was reviewed in the parent, which `record.link`
//                                                names from the `inheritedFrom` already on the step.
//
// EVERY LEGACY FIELD IS KEPT — `skipped`, `skipReason`, `skippedBy`, `skippedAt`, `inherited`,
// `inheritedFrom`, `boundHash`. Rule 3, add before you remove, and the fourth time this engine makes
// that choice. `stepStatus` translates the flags either way, so a chain written by a skill that has
// not been refreshed by `yad update` reads exactly like a migrated one.
//
// `boundHash` is deliberately NOT folded into the record. It is evidence the gate compares against a
// live hash (`gatePredicate`), not provenance a person reads — a record is why/who/when/where.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT TOUCH, and the one place the shape-7 story is genuinely awkward.
// `build-state/<story>.json` holds the same status words and is written by the `yad-run` and
// `yad-implement` SKILLS, not by the engine — so a rewrite here would be undone by their next write,
// and it is left alone. The awkward part is that those skills are the one existing writer of
// `blocked` in the NEW sense: `yad-run` halts a lane on a failed check, a scope overrun or a contract
// touch and marks the step `blocked`, meaning exactly "cannot proceed, not our choice". They now
// write a `record` with the halt cause alongside it (see their step-4 HALT branch), which is what
// keeps that halt distinguishable from a lane nobody started.
//
// A lane halted by an OLDER yad-run carries a bare `blocked` and therefore reads as `todo`. Nothing
// advances past it either way — `isPassed` is false for both — so what is lost is the word, until
// the next run rewrites the file. That is the cost of not migrating a file whose writer is a skill,
// and it is smaller than rewriting a file the next write would undo. `buildNextForRepo` goes through
// `stepStatus` like every other reader.
//
// Add-only and idempotent: a step whose `status` already IS its canonical state is returned
// untouched, so a second `yad migrate` and every later gate write are no-ops. A status this release
// cannot name is left exactly as it stands — the file wins (rule 3) — and `yad doctor` reports it as
// `step:unknown-status` rather than this function guessing what it meant.
//
// ONE of these, called from `writeState` below and from the 6 -> 7 step in cli/migrate.mjs. Both
// paths must produce byte-identical files (cli/test-migrate.mjs pins it), which is why the rewrite
// keeps `status` in the position it already held (spreading then overriding an existing key does not
// move it) and appends `record` at the end.

//
// ONE place that says what a step IS. Before this, the answer was spread across five tables in this
// file, an order array, two artifact helpers, and a hand-written `state.json` seed copied into five
// skill files — so "which phase is `stories` in", "which skill authors it", "what does it produce"
// and "what reviews it" were four separate lookups that nothing held together.
//
// THE DATA IS IN JSON NOW (E134). The rows are no longer written here: they are built from the shipped
// lifecycle default, `cli/lifecycle/defaults/1.json`, by `expandSteps` (cli/lifecycle.mjs). In that file
// an author step names its gate once (`gate: { riskTags }`) and its gate row is derived from that.
// The rows, their fields and their order are exactly what this table held before; a test compares them
// with a frozen copy (`cli/fixtures/lifecycle-v4-catalogue.json`).
//
// Everything below this constant is DERIVED from it. `STEP_SKILL`, `BUILD_STEP_SKILL`,
// `BUILD_STEP_ORDER`, `SHAPE_STEP_PHASE` and `BUILD_STEP_PHASE` are still exported under the names
// they had, because ~20 call sites and the golden test use them — but they are now VIEWS of this
// table, not sources beside it. A test deep-equals each one against what the catalogue says, so a
// step added here and forgotten there cannot happen, and neither can the reverse.
//
// WHAT THIS TABLE IS NOT. The catalogue is the data structure the rest of Wave 2b keys off, and each
// of those is its own task: which steps an epic walks and in what order is a lifecycle profile (E5,
// below), seeding a chain from one is `yad epic new` (E17, cli/epic.mjs); how many approvals each step's
// gate ASKS FOR — the base enforced, the risk step reported and capped by the active people (E72) until
// E108 — is `gateRuleFor` and `gateCapFor` at the top of this file (E7, E62, E72), which read
// the `risk_tags` a seed copies from the row below into the epic's own `state.json`;
// the fuller step-state model is E38. The `skill` column stays here as the shipped DEFAULT, and a
// project overrides it in `.sdlc/skills.json` (E6, below), for every epic or for one route only
// (E51: `profiles.<id>.steps`, which wins over the project-wide line). Three of the five
// skills that used to hand-write a seed now run `yad epic new` instead (E17b), `yad-discovery` runs
// `yad foundation new` (E75), and `yad-change` runs `yad epic new --parent` for a threaded change-epic
// (E42).
//
// NOTHING IS WRITTEN TO A PROJECT. The default ships inside the package and no project file holds
// these rows, so no file shape changes and there is nothing to migrate. When a project's `state.json` disagrees with the catalogue, THE FILE WINS for
// this whole major (rule 3): a project may hold a step from a newer yadflow, and a hand-written chain
// is allowed to be ahead of the tool reading it. `yad doctor` reports the disagreement and changes
// nothing — the same discipline as `workItemType`.
//
// The row fields, each of which had a home somewhere before:
//   id        the step id as it appears in `state.json` `steps[]`
//   phase     which of the six phases it belongs to (was SHAPE_STEP_PHASE / BUILD_STEP_PHASE)
//   kind      'author' (produces an artifact) or 'review' (a gate on one)
//   artifact  what it produces or reviews, relative to the epic dir (was only in the skill seeds)
//   skill     the skill that runs it (was STEP_SKILL / BUILD_STEP_SKILL). Review gates in Shape are
//             driven by the `yad gate` CLI and have none; `engineer-review` is a Build step in its own
//             right — the locked human merge gate — and does have one.
//   reviews   for a review gate, the id of the author step it gates. This replaces stripping
//             `-review` off a string, which is what made `checks-review` look resolvable.
//   level     'feature' (a step on the Epic ladder) or 'product' (the Foundation, `EP-foundation`, and
//             its older spelling `EP-discovery` — product-level, never on the feature lifecycle, and
//             placed in the Foundation phase, which belongs to no Part (E75)). This field was called
//             `chain` when E4 landed and was renamed before any release carried it — `chain` is the
//             word for an ordered LIST of steps, which is what a lifecycle profile holds (E5).
//   risk_tags the DEFAULT tags a seed gives this step (from its author step's `gate.riskTags`), copied into the epic's `state.json` where a team
//             may add to them by hand. `architecture-review` carries `contract`, which does two separate
//             things: it marks the step escalated (`isEscalated`, so its review PR names the touched
//             repos), and it sets the step's E7 RISK STEP — `contract` +2,
//             `auth` / `payments` +1, nothing +0, the maximum across the tags and never their sum. The
//             rule that turns those tags into a number of approvals is `gateRuleFor`, at the top of this
//             file; it reads the epic's recorded tags, not this row.
//
// `spec` and `tasks` are two legs of the same yad-spec ceremony (run-loop.md) and share a skill; the

// not steps and are not here.

// in what order. Two epics can now take different routes without the engine pretending every piece of
// work is the same size.
//
// THE WORD. The roadmap calls this a profile, so that is the word (rule: the roadmap's vocabulary
// wins). `hub.json` already carries an unrelated `profile` — the SETUP answers `{ codebase,
// repo_layout, team_size }` that `yad setup` records — so nothing here is called plain `profile` in
// code, and `next.mjs` reads the other one through `setupProfileOf`. Two different things under one
// word is a trap for whoever reads this next; two clearly different names is not.
//
// THE DATA IS IN JSON NOW (E134). The profiles are built from the `routes` of the shipped lifecycle
// default, `cli/lifecycle/defaults/1.json`, by `expandRoutes` (cli/lifecycle.mjs). There, a route lists
// only its author steps and the engine adds each step's gate; a route's `name` is the `title` here. The
// default also holds one more route, `lane` — the Build order one story walks in one repo — which is not
// a profile, because an epic never walks it; it is `BUILD_STEP_ORDER` below. A test compares the
// profiles with a frozen copy of the list as it stood before.
//
// THE FIRST THREE WERE NOT NEW ROUTES. They predate this table — they were seeded by hand, in five
// skill files, until `yad epic new` took over the two feature ones. `yad-analysis`'s own description already calls them "the 12-step chain" and "the 10-step
// chain". E5 wrote them down in one place and checks projects against them; it did not change what
// any epic does, and nothing here is written to disk.
//
//   classic         the 10-step chain, seeded by yad-epic, yad-stub and yad-change. `epic` first.
//   analysis-first  the 12-step chain, seeded by yad-analysis, which puts `analysis` before `epic`
//                   when a feature is shaped by the analyst before it becomes an epic.
//   chore           the upkeep lane (E40). Four steps: `epic` then `stories`.
//   spike           the investigation lane (E40). Six steps: `analysis` in front of the chore lane.
//   discovery       the product front-zero (`EP-discovery`), two steps and no Build. The OLD spelling
//                   of the Product level, still read for this major; `yad migrate` converts it.
//   foundation      the Product level (E75), `EP-foundation` in `foundation/`. Two steps, no Build.
//
// THE SHORT LANES ARE NEW, and they are the first routes here that nobody has ever walked. E40 adds
// them because the engine had exactly one shape of work: until now a dependency bump was seeded on the
// same 10-step chain as a payments rewrite, and the way through was to skip steps — which `classic`
// does not permit, since only `ui-design` is optional on it. Making the whole chain optional to fit
// upkeep would have made it optional for everything. A shorter ROUTE says the same thing honestly, and
// says it once, at seed time, where a person chooses it.
//
// WHAT THE TWO LANES DROP, and why each is ABSENT rather than `optional`. An optional step stays in
// the chain, pre-marked done with a recorded reason (E35) — that is the right shape for a step the
// route genuinely has and this epic happens not to need. A step the route never has is not that:
// writing `ui-design` into the chore lane as optional would make every chore epic carry a skip record
// for a screen nobody was ever going to draw, and the audit trail would fill with noise that means
// nothing.
//
//   architecture / architecture-review   Both lanes drop them, and dropping the architecture gate
//       drops the CONTRACT with it — no `contract.md`, no `contract-lock.json`. That is the point:
//       these lanes are for work that does not move the shared cross-repo surface. Work that does move
//       it belongs on `classic`, whatever its size. `yad doctor`'s contract-lock check is silent on an
//       epic with no lock file, which is the normal pre-lock state and also the permanent state here.
//       The gap this leaves in the check gates is written up on the E40 row of the roadmap.
//   ui-design / ui-design-review         `chore` is "upkeep, no user-visible change" by the
//       definition of the work-item type, so there is no screen; a spike's prototype is thrown away,
//       so designing one would be work the lane exists to avoid.
//   test-cases / test-cases-review       Neither lane introduces behaviour to pin. A chore must not
//       change what the product does, and a spike's output is a finding, not a shipped feature. The
//       tests that guard the code a chore touches already exist and its Build gates still run them.
//
// WHAT NEITHER LANE DROPS is `epic` / `epic-review` and `stories` / `stories-review`, and that is not
// a matter of taste. `epic.md` is where the work-item type and the `parent:` lineage are authored —
// `workItemType` reads it, `lineage-check.sh` reads it inside the user's repo, and `yad thread` skips
// an epic that has none entirely, so a lane without it would produce work that is invisible to every
// rollup. `stories` is what tags the repos Build runs in, and `stories-review` is the step
// `advanceState` turns into `ready-for-build`. A lane ending anywhere else would leave `currentStep`
// at a sentinel claiming a Build that has nothing in it.
//
// WHY `spike` IS `chore` PLUS `analysis`. The distinction is whether the answer is known. A chore is
// upkeep somebody has already decided on: bump the dependency, move the CI job. A spike is a
// timeboxed investigation — the analyst's brief is the first artifact because reducing the
// uncertainty IS the work. Everything after that is the same short route, which is why one is a
// strict ordered subset of the other. `matchLifecycleProfile` breaks the resulting tie on the shorter
// route, so a chore-shaped chain reads as `chore` and not as a spike that skipped its analysis.
//
// WHAT IS AND IS NOT HERE. Seeding a chain from a profile is `seedState` below, driven by
// `yad epic new` (E17, cli/epic.mjs); shape 6 is where an epic first RECORDS which profile it is on,
// and an epic seeded before that field existed still has its route derived by matching its chain
// (`matchLifecycleProfile`). Which steps are optional per route lives in the routes too and is read per
// EPIC (E35, `optionalStepsFor`); the short chore and spike lanes are E40. Which skill runs a step
// is bound per project (E6, below) and, more specifically, per route (E51) — both in
// `.sdlc/skills.json`, never here, so two routes can run different skills for the same step.

// step (E35). The parallel `test-cases` track is deliberately NOT recorded here: `advanceState`
// decides it from the step id, and a flag nothing reads would be a second copy of a rule that lives
// somewhere else — free to drift, with every test still green. Moving that rule into the profile is
// worth doing, and it belongs to whichever task takes it, not to a field added on spec here.

// read the key would compare it with itself; and `stampProfile` calls this to fill the key in the
// first place, for every epic that existed before shape 6. A chain that has never been recorded is
// the normal case for those, and this is the only answer available for it.
//
// A chain MATCHES a profile when every step it carries belongs to that profile and they appear in the
// profile's order. Missing steps are allowed — an epic with no screens legitimately drops `ui-design`,

//

//
// A step may be marked N/A ("skipped") when the epic does not need it. UI-design is the only step any
// route marks optional today, and only `classic` and `analysis-first` mark it: an epic with no
// user-facing surface (backend/API, data, infra) can skip it. The short lanes mark NOTHING optional —
// they left the steps they do not need out of the chain instead, which is a different mechanism with a
// different audit trail, so "this epic has no optional steps" no longer implies its chain is broken
// (see `notOptional`). A skip carries a recorded reason and stays VISIBLE in the chain — both the author step and its review gate
// pre-marked `done`, short-circuited by `gatePredicate` — the auditable, reversible counterpart to
// omitting `analysis` from the chain entirely.
//
// IT IS A FACT ABOUT THE ROUTE, NOT ABOUT THE ENGINE. Until E35 this was one module-level set, the
// union of every route's `optional` marks, and it answered the same for every epic in the project.
// That is wrong the moment two routes disagree, and E40 made them disagree in the sharper of the two
// possible ways. A union across routes answers with every route's marks pooled, so the moment ANY
// route marked a step optional, every epic in the project could skip it — silently, because a union
// never says which route its answer came from. The short lanes are the opposite case and still break
// it: they mark nothing, so pooling would hand a `chore` epic `classic`'s optional `ui-design` and let
// it skip a step its chain does not even contain.
//
// The union is gone. `optionalStepsFor(state)` asks THIS epic's route and nothing else.

// The optional AUTHOR steps of ONE route, in chain order. Author steps only — `isSkippableStep` pairs
// each with its `-review` gate, which is the shape every caller expects. A route this release does not
// carry has none, which is the honest answer rather than an error: the chain is what it is.
//
// The rows are read off the route that was HANDED IN, never by resolving its id, for the reason
// `matchLifecycleProfile` spells out — a caller-supplied route is not in the module's own index, so
// resolving would come back empty and every synthetic route in a test would silently have no optional
// steps, agreeing with a broken implementation.

// WHICH route an epic is on, for the purpose of asking what it may skip.
//
// The RECORDED key wins whenever it names a route this release carries — including when the CHAIN no
// longer fits that route. Two separate reasons, and the second is the load-bearing one:
//
//   * Guessing is worse. `matchLifecycleProfile` picks the shortest fitting route, so a `classic` epic
//     that legitimately dropped a step can read as a shorter lane; E40 adds two shorter lanes. Shape 6
//     exists precisely so the route stops being guessed. Matching is the fallback for an epic seeded
//     before the key existed, not the first answer.
//   * A chain this release cannot place is not a broken chain. Rule 3: the file wins. An epic written
//     by a NEWER yadflow carries a step this one has never heard of, so it fits no route HERE — and
//     reading that as "no route" would strip its optional steps, which means an already-skipped
//     `ui-design` stops short-circuiting and its gate starts asking for approvals nobody gave. An
//     older CLI silently downgrading a newer project is exactly what rule 3 forbids.
//
// A recorded route the chain contradicts is `profile:disagree`, and `yad doctor` reports it. Reporting
// is the remedy; refusing to answer is not.
//
// When NEITHER resolves there is NO route, never a default one. Stamping `classic` on an epic that
// records nothing and matches nothing would let a step be skipped on the strength of a route nobody
// chose, quietly — the same reason `stampProfile` declines to invent the key in the first place.

// ---- "this epic's route never had that step" — ONE rule, three readers (E40) -----------------------
//
// Asked by `yad next`'s phase line, by the review-PR checklist, and by the thread's artifact-ownership
// map. All three used to work it out from the CHAIN, and all three were wrong in the same way.
//
// A CHAIN IS ALLOWED TO BE SHORT WITHOUT ITS ROUTE BEING SHORT. Every hand-written and pre-shape-6
// ledger is a truncated `classic` — `matchLifecycleProfile` says as much ("a chain seeded before a
// step existed simply lacks it"), and this repo's own e2e fixtures are `[epic, epic-review]`. Reading
// "no `architecture` row" as "this route has no architecture step" tells a `classic` epic it is on a
// short lane, and strips a legacy epic of artifacts that are sitting on its disk. Inventing an owner
// and losing one are the same error.
//
// So the answer comes from the RECORDED route and nothing else, and it is deliberately conservative:
// FALSE unless the epic itself says which route it is on AND this release carries that route AND that
// route has no such step. No key, an unknown key, or an unreadable ledger all mean "assume it has the
// step", which is the answer every one of these readers gave before the short lanes existed.
//
// This is narrower than `epicProfileId`, on purpose. A best-available guess is right for deciding what
// a step MAY skip — a wrong guess there is a refusal a person immediately sees. It is not right for a
// silent claim about an epic's future or its provenance, where a wrong guess is believed.
//
// A SKIPPED STEP IS NOT A MISSING ONE, and asking the route rather than the chain gets that for free:
// `ui-design` skipped on `classic` is still a step the route has, so the epic still owns the decision.
// That is the distinction E35 exists to draw, and it needs no special case here.

//
// The two PRODUCT routes, `foundation` and its old spelling `discovery`, are excluded because the
// Product level is not a work item on the Epic ladder. Its ledger carries a top-level `kind` marker the
// engine keys off, its id is fixed, and it has no `epic.md` and therefore no work-item type. A seed that

// `writeState` like every other save.
//
// WHY THE FIRST STEP IS `in_progress` AND NOT `done`. The skill templates this replaced wrote the
// first author step `done` and its gate `in_review`, because by the time a skill seeded, it had
// already WRITTEN the artifact — the seed was a record of work finished. The engine seeds before any
// work exists, so the honest chain is: the first author step open, everything after it blocked, and
// `currentStep` on the first step. `yad next` then names that step and the skill that authors it,
// which is the whole point of seeding ahead of the author instead of behind it.
//
// FIELD ORDER IS THE FILE'S BYTES, and it is the order those deleted templates used. Every chain on
// disk in every existing project was written that way, so ordering the keys differently here would
// churn the bytes of any epic gate-written after an upgrade — on a verified Product, one CI commit per
// epic saying nothing. It is also still the order `yad-discovery` and `yad-change` write, which are
// the two seeds the engine deliberately does not own.
//
// BOTH DIAL NAMES ARE WRITTEN — `assistance`/`automation` beside `driver`/`advance`. The old pair is
// still the one every reader outside this repo uses (rule 3, add before remove), and a seed that
// wrote only the new names would produce an epic that a user's un-updated check gates cannot read.

// A STUB is the one variation, and it is a variation of the STATUSES, not of the chain. `yad-stub`
// mints an anchor for a feature that was built before the Product existed, so a defect can thread off
// it today: the same `classic` chain, every step `blocked`, a top-level `kind: "stub"` marker and the
// `backfill-pending` sentinel as `currentStep`. Nothing is runnable until `yad-backfill promote` wakes
// it — `preconditionsMet` refuses every step of an anchor, and `nextAction` routes it to the backfill
// skill rather than to authoring. Modelled here rather than in a second function because it differs

//
// SEVERAL SKILLS PER STEP IS A CHAIN, NEVER A PANEL (closed decision 7). They run in the order given,
// each one seeing what the one before it produced, and the LAST output is the artifact. A panel — run
// three, pick one — needs a picking step, which is either a human reading three architectures or an AI
// judge nobody should trust inside a governance tool. One skill is the default; more is opt-in, and
// every surface that prints a chain of more than one says it costs more.
//
// The file, all of it optional:
//
//   {
//     "schemaVersion": 6,
//     "steps": {
//       "architecture": "my-architecture-skill",
//       "stories": ["shape-the-stories", "yad-stories"]
//     }
//   }
//
// A value may be one skill or a list of them; both are read back as a list, so nothing downstream has
// to handle two shapes. The wrapper object exists so that later rows can add keys beside `steps`
// without the file changing shape — and E51 did:
//
//     "profiles": {
//       "spike": { "steps": { "epic": "spike-epic" } }
//     }
//
// A binding under `profiles.<id>` applies only to an epic that RECORDS that route (`recordedRoute`,
// below — never a route guessed from its chain). THE MOST SPECIFIC LINE WINS: the route's
// own line, then the project-wide `steps`, then the catalogue. A team that binds `epic` for `spike`
// gets it on spike epics only, and its project-wide lines still cover every other route. No shape
// moves: an older yadflow keeps the unknown key (`yad skill bind` writes the document it read) and
// simply runs the project-wide answer for every route.

// The catalogue's own answer for a step, Shape or Build. One lookup, because a step id belongs to
// exactly one of the two tables (`catalogueSkills` splits them on the same `phase === 'build'` rule),
// and a caller asking "which skill runs `implement`" should not have to know which half it is in.
// `__proto__: null` because this is looked up by a step id read out of a project's `state.json`, and
// on a normal object literal `Object.prototype` answers for `constructor`, `toString` and friends. A
// chain carrying a step called `constructor` would otherwise resolve its "skill" to a function.

//
// Junk is DROPPED here rather than rejected, and that is deliberate: this runs inside `yad next`,
// which must keep working on a project whose config file someone mistyped. An empty string, an empty
// list, a number, a nested object — each simply leaves that step on its catalogue default, and
// `yad doctor` is what tells the user their line did nothing. A command that refuses to say what to do
// next because a config file has a stray comma would be the worse failure.
// Written with `defineProperty`, not `out[id] = …`. A plain assignment of the key `__proto__` sets
// the object's PROTOTYPE instead of adding a key, so a binding spelled that way would vanish
// completely — unlisted by `yad skill list` and unreported by all three doctor checks, which is
// exactly the invisible binding those checks exist to catch. The object keeps its normal prototype;
// `stepSkills` guards the LOOKUP side with `Object.hasOwn` instead.
//

// and the two surfaces would disagree about it: the rendered Build chain folds them (that is what

// ---- the six phases ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Between the three PARTS (Shape · Build · Run) and the individual steps sits one more rung: the
// phase. Six of them, in order, each belonging to exactly one part:
//
//   Discover   Shape   discovery · analysis · epic, each with its gate
//   Design     Shape   architecture (with the locked contract) · ui-design, each with its gate
//   Plan       Shape   stories · test-cases, each with its gate
//   Build      Build   spec · tasks · implement · checks · engineer-review
//   Release    Run     PLANNED — release notes · version · deploy record · gate
//   Operate    Run     PLANNED — defects · feedback · retrospective · improvements
//
// Release and Operate are NAMED and not built. No step, skill or gate exists for either, and none is
// invented: `built: false` is the whole of what is known about them. (`skills/sdlc/config.yaml`
// carries the same table for the skills to read, generated from the lifecycle default by
// `scripts/lifecycle-config.mjs`, and a test fails when the two differ.) They are listed
// rather than left out because a person has to be able to see that the lifecycle does not stop at
// merge — and a renderer that shows them as planned tells the truth, while one that hides them
// implies the work ends at Build.
//
// DERIVED, NOT STORED. A step's phase is a pure function of its id — it comes off the step catalogue
// (E4, above), so nothing is written into `state.json` and there is no file-shape change. Storing it
// would put a second copy of the catalogue on disk, and the two copies would then need a doctor check
// to catch a drift that cannot happen while there is only one answer.
//
// "PHASE" IS A CROWDED WORD IN THIS REPOSITORY, and none of the other three mean this one:
//   * `cli/gate.mjs` says "merge phase" for a stage INSIDE a single gate run;
//   * the `build-state` notes say "Phase 4a/4b", from the old build-plan numbering;
//   * `docs/phase-N-build-plan.md` are the development phases of yadflow itself.
// So the phase NUMBER is deliberately never printed: "Phase 4" already means something else to anyone
// who has read those. The name is what is shown.
//
// Built from the `phases` of the lifecycle default (`cli/lifecycle/defaults/1.json`, E134) by
// `featurePhases`. There each phase also says whether it runs once or in a loop (`runs`, `over`); those
// fields are not part of this view, which keeps exactly the fields it always had.
export const PHASES = featurePhases(DEFAULT_LIFECYCLE);

// The PRODUCT level's phase (E75). Kept out of `PHASES` on purpose, because the roadmap's two levels
// are two different ladders: a feature epic walks the six phases above, once per epic, and the
// Foundation runs once per product, before any of them. It belongs to no Part — Shape, Build and Run
// are the rhythms of FEATURE work — so it has no `part`, and a renderer printing the six-phase strip
// for a Foundation would claim a journey it never takes. Built from the default by `productPhases`.
export const PRODUCT_PHASES = productPhases(DEFAULT_LIFECYCLE);

// Which phase each step belongs to. Split in two on purpose, because the `-review` rule differs.
//
// SHAPE steps each have a review gate named `<id>-review`, and that gate belongs to the phase of the
// artifact it reviews — `epic-review` is Discover beside `epic`. BUILD steps have no such gates:
// `engineer-review` is a step in its own right, the locked human merge gate, not the review of a step
// called `engineer`. So the suffix is only ever stripped against the Shape table, which is what keeps
// `checks-review` — a step that does not exist — from quietly resolving into Build.
//
// Every id in STEP_SKILL and BUILD_STEP_SKILL above appears in one of these two, and a test asserts
// membership directly rather than through `stepPhase`, so a step added to one table and forgotten
// here fails rather than resolving by accident.
//
// The roadmap also names a `feasibility` step in Discover. Nothing implements it — no skill, no step
// id, no gate — so it is deliberately absent from the catalogue rather than declared and dead. A new
// step is added by adding it to the lifecycle default (a new default file, since a shipped one never
// changes); RENAMING one means adding the new row beside the old and
// keeping both for a major (rule 3), because a project still carrying the old id would otherwise trip
// `phase:unknown` on every `yad doctor` run until it is migrated.
//
// Both tables are now VIEWS of the catalogue (E4). A row is listed under its phase unless it is a
// review gate that gates ANOTHER step — that is, unless it carries `reviews`. That one rule is what
// keeps `epic-review` out (it is the gate on `epic`, which is already listed) while keeping
// `engineer-review` in (it gates nothing; it is the last step of Build in its own right), and it is
// the same distinction the `-review` strip below depends on.

//   * `ready-for-build` is a marker, not a step, so `stepPhase` gives it nothing — and it is the

//     `build-state`. So a step lookup alone can never place an epic in Build at all, which is the
//     phase with the most steps in it. The marker means "Shape is approved, Build can run" — that is
//     Build, and it is resolved here rather than in `stepPhase`, which stays a pure id lookup.
//   * The PRODUCT level (`EP-foundation`, or its old spelling `EP-discovery`) is not a work item on the
//     feature ladder. It is in the Foundation phase for its whole life — while authoring, in review,
//     and once its `-done` sentinel is reached — and it never enters Design, Plan or Build. So the
//     answer is decided by the LEVEL, which the caller knows from the ledger's `kind`, and not by the
//     step id: a sentinel has no phase of its own, and asking `stepPhase` would lose the Foundation the
//     moment it was approved.

//     write. Not the first `# ` heading: the template has none, and a heading is prose, reworded freely.
//   - An item with no key falls back to the `title` its `change.json` holds — only change items have
//     one (`yad-change` has required a title from the start), so this covers the change items written
//     before the key existed. The frontmatter key wins when both exist.
//   - No title is `null`, never a guess (not the Goal's first sentence, not the id): a screen prints the
//     id in its place, and nothing warns. Approved `epic.md` files are NOT back-filled — the epic review
//     is bound to a hash of the file, so adding a line would drop the approval as stale.
//   - The Foundation has no `epic.md`, so its title is a constant.
//
// Normalized HERE, once, like the theme. It is ONE line: every run of whitespace, a newline included,
// becomes one space (NEL, U+0085, is a line break too), because a list prints one title per row. Control
// characters are dropped: a title is printed to other people's terminals (E20), and an ESC or a BEL
// there would rewrite or ring them. So are the bidi controls, which reverse how the rest of a row is
// SHOWN, so one title can pass for another. Zero-width characters (the joiners among them) are kept:
// emoji and several scripts (Persian among them) need them.
//
// The frontmatter value is also unquoted, because `readFrontmatter` keeps the rest of the line as

// Automation used to be EARNED: the `yad-run` skill refused `advance: auto` until a step's trust log
// cleared a threshold. E34 deletes that. The dial is the team's to set, `yad dial` shows the run record as
// advice, and a recorded kill switch holds every step at `human`. What never moves is rule 1: a gate
// (`isGateStep`) is `human`, whatever any file says.
//
// TWO HOMES, because the two parts are written by different hands. A Build lane's dial stays on the
// lane, in `build-state/<story>.json`, where `yad-run` already reads it. A Shape author step's dial is
// project-wide, in `.sdlc/automation.json` beside the kill switch: `state.json` belongs to CI on a
// verified Product, so a dial written there could not be changed by the team it belongs to.
//
// A SHAPE `auto` IS RECORDED, NOT ACTED ON — yet. Nothing drives a Shape step on its own until the engine
// runs agents (E26, Wave 3.5). The same pattern as E7's approver count: the value is real, stored and
// shown, and the command that prints it says so.
export const ADVANCE_VALUES = ['human', 'auto'];

// `.sdlc/automation.json` as the readers see it: `{ kill, steps, error }`. An absent file is the
// defaults — the switch off and every Shape step `human`. A file that is there and wrong carries an
// `error`, and `killSwitchOn` reads an error as ON: of the two ways to be wrong about a safety switch,
// holding everything at `human` is the one nobody gets hurt by. `steps` keeps its values as written, so
// `yad doctor` can name a bad one; the readers honour only `auto`.
//
// `actions` (issue #356) holds the dials of the ACTIONS the project allows without asking — today only
// `open-pr`, a standing approval to open a task's PR/MR once its checks pass. Not under `steps`: an action
// is not a step of any chain, so nothing that walks the catalogue sees it.
