// E20 — `yad history`: what the Product has done, read from the work items' own files.
//
//   yad history [list] [--type t] [--theme x] [--thread EP-…] [--open|--done] [--json]
//   yad history show <id> [--json]
//   yad history search <text> [the same filters] [--json]
//
// THE RULES, each one the user's decision (2026-09-24):
//   1. BUILT LIVE, every time, by `buildIndex` — the same builder `.sdlc/index.json` is made from, so the
//      two can never describe an item differently. The saved file is not read: it is behind on every
//      branch and after a skill hand-writes `state.json` (E17b), and `yad doctor` already says so. The
//      saved file stays the front door for apps and CI.
//   2. `list` shows EVERY work item, open and shape-done, NEWEST FIRST by its created date. A value that
//      is not a real calendar date sorts last — never guessed — and ties sort by id.
//   3. `show` prints the item's summary and lineage, then every step in chain order with its state and
//      its closing record (E18) — the author steps too, which nothing printed before — and, under each
//      review step, the approvals recorded for it (E64), judged by the rules the gate counts by.
//   4. `search` matches text, ignoring case, in each item's id, title, theme, type and repos, and in its
//      steps' closing records (who closed, who merged, the PR, the commit). Approvals and the text of an
//      artifact are not searched.
//   5. "SHAPE DONE", never "finished" (the PR review): an item's `state.json` holds its Shape steps only —
//      Build (the code, the checks, the code review) is tracked elsewhere — so an item whose Shape steps
//      are all closed may have shipped nothing. `--open` / `--done` and `shapeDone` say Shape only.
//   6. `--json` answers are E1's one format: `{ jsonVersion, version, command, ok, … }`, a refusal adding
//      `error`, `code` and `hint` — and every key of an answer is ALWAYS present (null, false or [] when
//      there is nothing), so a script never has to ask whether a key exists.
//
// What it reads: each work item's `state.json`, `epic.md` and `change.json` (the summary), and for `show`
// and `search` its `state.json` again and its `approvals.json`; `--thread` also reads the `epic.md` of
// the work items it walks through; `show` reads the Product's settings (`hub.json`/`product.json`) for
// solo mode and the engagement rule. Nothing is written.
//
// A work item whose files cannot be read is never dropped (E19): `list` and `search` name it under every
// answer, whatever the filters, because a filter cannot know what an unreadable item holds.
//
// Everything printed from a file goes through `printable` (control and bidi characters dropped, one
// line): these values reach other people's terminals, as titles do (E111). `--json` carries each value
// as the file holds it, except where a field is kept only when it is what it should be (an approver,
// status or date only when it is text, a PR only when it is a whole number) — never a value re-typed.
