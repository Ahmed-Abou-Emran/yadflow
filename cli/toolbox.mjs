// The toolbox — every external tool yadflow can use, what each one is for, how it installs, and what
// yadflow does without it (E84).
//
//   yad toolbox list [--json] [--dir <folder>]
//   yad toolbox check [--json] [--dir <folder>]
//   yad toolbox add <id> | add <id> --custom --role … --fallback … --detect … [--install …] [--source …]
//   yad toolbox remove <id>
//
// THE RULE IT EXISTS FOR: no external tool is ever mandatory, and every one declares a fallback. yadflow
// degrades; it never breaks. This file is the one place that says, per tool, what "degrades" means.
//
// NOT `manifest.mjs`. That is the INSTALL manifest — the files yadflow copies into a project. This list
// is about tools yadflow does NOT ship and never installs on its own.
//
// SHIPPED, NOT A PROJECT FILE (decided with E84). The list moves with each release, like the step
// catalogue. What a team CHOOSES from it is a project file, `.sdlc/toolbox.json` in the Product (E86):
// which shipped tools it uses or skips, and its own tools. See "the team's choices" below.
//
// THREE TIERS:
//   core         offered at setup (E85) — repomix, spec-kit, impeccable
//   recommended  listed, never pushed — pools of skills and agents a team may choose (Part 7)
//   connector    the tools a Product connects for design, testing and learning (`yad-connect-*`); the
//                same adapters `skills/sdlc/config.yaml` names, with the same fallbacks
//
// FINDING A TOOL RUNS NOTHING. It reads `yad detect`'s answer (E50) — skills, plugins, MCP servers — and
// looks for a program on PATH by reading folders, never by starting `which`. A tool that `npx` fetches
// on demand (repomix) is "available" whenever `npx` is there.
//
// AN OLD OR NEW VERSION WARNS, IT DOES NOT DISQUALIFY (decided with the row). A tool outside its known
// range still counts as installed: a slightly older tool usually works, and quietly switching to the
// weaker fallback would be worse. A range is only set where a version is actually visible (a plugin's or
// a skill's own record) and a known-good bound exists; `versions: null` means "no bound known".
//
// EVERY INSTALL COMMAND WAS CHECKED AGAINST THE TOOL'S OWN REPOSITORY OR DOCS, on the `checked` date —
// never guessed from a package name (npm `ecc` is an unrelated crypto library, not ECC). A connector set
// up inside a desktop app has no command: its `install` is empty and `manual` links the vendor's steps.

//
//   on           the day the vetting was done. Per entry: they all start on VETTED_ON, and re-vetting ONE
//                tool gives that entry its own date literal rather than moving the shared one
//   licenceFrom  where the licence was read — the repository's LICENSE file, or, for a closed tool, the
//                vendor's own terms page. `licence` on the entry is the answer; this is the proof
//   source       the official home the tool comes from (its owner's repository or docs)
//   release      the source's latest release tag on that day, or null where none is published. A tag is
//                provenance, not a version: tags read `v1.18.1`, `skill-v4.5.0`, `cli-2.11.0`
//   packages     each registry package an install route names, confirmed to point back to `source`
//                (npm `repository`, or the source's own README naming it), with the version on that day
//   note         anything a reader of the record has to know — a missing LICENSE, a rebrand
//
// Licence and source only, as decided with the row: no maintenance score, no security scan, and no
// tested version range — `versions` stays null. A team's own tools (`yad toolbox add --custom`) are the
// team's to vet; yad vets only the list it ships.
//
// TWO GATES. The unit suite holds every record complete (`vettingProblems`); the release check refuses
// to publish while any record is older than VET_MAX_AGE_DAYS (`staleVettings`, `scripts/vet-check.mjs`).
// The age is checked only at release, never in the unit suite, so `main` does not turn red by itself.
