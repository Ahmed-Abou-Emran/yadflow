// `yad run checks` (issue #347): run every pull request gate on this machine before pushing, so a failure
// shows here and not after a CI round trip. The same words for a GitHub pull request and a GitLab merge
// request.
//
// What makes "passes here" mean "passes in CI":
//   - the repo's OWN installed `checks/` scripts run, not the templates this package ships — CI runs the
//     installed copies. One whose content differs from the shipped template is named.
//   - the base is the branch the change will merge into, chosen as `yad open-pr` chooses it
//     (`resolveBaseBranch`: the registry, then origin/HEAD; on the Product itself its own settings
//     between them), fetched first.
//   - the four Product-reading gates read the Product's DEFAULT BRANCH, as CI's product-checkout.sh
//     clones it (the user's decision, 2026-10-19): it is written out from the local Product clone's
//     `origin/<default_branch>` to where `.sdlc/product-link.json` ON THE BASE says, just before those
//     four gates, and removed right after them — so the build gates never see it, as in CI. Written with
//     a private index: the Product clone's own index, branch and files are never touched. The path gets
//     the checks product-checkout.sh applies (no symlink on the way, nothing tracked there). A run removes
//     only what it wrote itself; a folder already there is read as it is and kept.
//   - every gate runs, even after one fails (CI jobs run side by side), then one summary.
//
// What cannot be the same here, and says so:
//   - verified-commits asks the platform for its Verified badge, which an unpushed commit does not have.
//     Locally each commit's signature is checked with git instead (`%G?`); the badge is judged in CI.
//   - member-check needs the PR's author, which only the platform event carries. It runs when no member
//     file changes, and otherwise is left to CI with a note.
//   - pr-title and pr-template need text the PR does not have yet: --title and --body <file>, with the
//     subject of a one-commit branch as the title (it becomes the squash title).
//   - CI on GitHub tests the merge of the branch into the base; here it is the branch tip. A note says so
//     when the branch is not on top of the base.
//   - the build gates use this machine's Node and tools.
