# Ship — the build ledger and the story state

Step E (`yad-engineer-review`) closes Build: AI review (advisory) → engineer review (the human gate) →
ship. Shipping records the merge and updates the story state so the whole chain is traceable.

## Two sets of eyes

1. **AI review (advisory).** CodeRabbit (`.coderabbit.yaml`) reviews each PR and comments. It is a
   second set of eyes — it **never approves or merges**. Its findings inform the engineer; they do not
   gate. Where CodeRabbit can't run (no remote), an equivalent AI first-pass is run by hand and its
   notes captured.
2. **Engineer review (the authority).** A human reads the diff against the spec and the acceptance
   criteria and records an approval. The rule is `yad-review-gate`'s count, in distinct approvers:
   - **base (enforced):** 1 distinct approver, who should not be the author. This holds the merge.
   - **full count (advisory):** base 1 + a risk step from the PR's Impact & Risk block — `high` risk
     +1, a touched contract surface +2 — or from the base branch's risk map, where a change touching a
     `high` directory adds +1 (E66). The largest step, never the sum. Exactly what `risk-route.sh` prints,
     run in the code repo on the PR's branch.
     The risk step holds nothing on a code PR: branch protection holds the merge. `yad open-pr` shows
     the count capped by the active people (E72), for information only. The touched domains it lists are a hint
     for whom to ask.

   The actual merge protection is the platform's branch protection.

## The build ledger — shard-then-fold (`epics/<epic>/.sdlc/build-log/` → `build-log.json`)

Append-only, one record per shipped task, written by **`yad build ship <story> --task <T> --repo <r> --pr <n>`**
(#346) from the merged PR/MR — never by hand. It fills `branch`, `pr`, `mergeCommit`, `gates` (the checks
that passed on GitHub; the passing job names of the MR's head pipeline on GitLab, one page, child pipelines
not included), `engineer_review` (approvers bound to the merged head, with the engagement signal), `risk`
(the body's `Risk level:`, or `null`), `companion.trailer` (the body's `<!-- yad:trailer -->` marker; `cards`
and `chat` are `false`), `ai_review` (`null`: the platform does not say) and `shippedAt` (the merge date).
With no platform to read, `--merge-commit <sha>` and `--approver <login>` record the commit and the
approvers, and the rest is empty. **`yad build merged <story> --task <T> --repo <r> [--pr <n>] --ship`**
(#355) asks the platform whether the task's PR/MR has merged — found by the task id in its source branch,
among the repo's newest 100 — and, once it has, records the ship by running `yad build ship` for it; its
`state` is `shipped`, `merged`, `open`, `closed` or `none`, so the agent checks by itself instead of waiting
to be told the PR merged. **Storage mirrors the trust log's "loose objects + `git gc`"
model** so two people shipping different tasks of the same epic never collide on one file:
- **Per-ship shard:** each ship is its own file `epics/<epic>/.sdlc/build-log/<story>-<task>-<repo>.json`
  = ONE ship object (the record below). `(story, task, repo)` is already unique, so no `uid` is needed;
  concurrent shippers write different files → zero merge conflict.
- **Folded file:** `epics/<epic>/.sdlc/build-log.json` = `{ "epic": "<id>", "ships": [ … ] }` — the
  legacy single-file layout, and where `yad tidy up` folds finished shards.
- **Union-read rule:** to read the ledger, union the folded `ships` with every `build-log/` shard,
  **deduping by `(story, task, repo)`** — a loose shard WINS over a stale folded ship of the same key.
- `yad review reconcile` stamps the engagement signal by **mutating the ship's shard** where it lives
  (or the folded entry if the story was already tidied) — see below.
- `yad checkpoint` commits the shard dir; `yad tidy up` (manual, one person) folds a shipped story's
  finished shards into `build-log.json`.

The folded file is shown below; a **shard** file is just one element of `ships` (the bare ship object,
without the `{ epic, ships }` wrapper):

```json
{
  "epic": "EP-checkout",
  "ships": [
    {
      "story": "EP-checkout-S01",
      "task": "T01",
      "repo": "backend",
      "branch": "feat/EP-checkout-S01-T01-create-order",
      "pr": "<url|#|none|local>",
      "mergeCommit": "<sha>",
      "gates": ["spec-link", "contract-check", "build-test-lint"],
      "ai_review": null,
      "engineer_review": [
        { "approver": "amelia-dev", "engagement": "verified" },
        { "approver": "carol-k", "engagement": "none" }
      ],
      "companion": { "trailer": true, "cards": false, "chat": false },
      "risk": "low",
      "shippedAt": "2026-06-06",
      "followUps": [
        { "pr": "<url|#|local>", "branch": "fix/EP-checkout-S01-T01-followup-null-check", "mergeCommit": "<sha>", "date": "2026-06-09" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Grouped PRs (#350).** Several small tasks of one story may share a PR/MR, each commit keeping its own
`Task:` line. Each task ships from it with `yad build ship <story> --task <T> --repo <r> --pr <n>`: the PR
carries a task when its branch names it **or** its commits' `Task:` trailers do (each commit's first, read as spec-link reads it; asked of the platform), so
every ship of the group records the same PR and merge commit. By hand, where the platform cannot be read,
the merge commit's own merged range (`<sha>^1..<sha>^2`) is read for the `Task:` lines; a squash merge has
none, so only the task it names ships that way.

**Follow-ups (#350).** A fix to a task that has already shipped goes on a **follow-up branch**,
`fix/<story>-<task>-followup-<words>` (for example `fix/EP-checkout-S01-T01-followup-null-check`). Its
commits keep the task's `Task:` line, so spec-link passes unchanged. Once it merges, its merge is **added to
the task's ship** — never a second ship — by `yad build ship <story> --task <T> --repo <r> --pr <n> --follow-up`,
or by `yad build merged … --follow-up --ship`, which asks the platform about the task's follow-up PRs/MRs.
`followUps` is optional (absent until the first one) and lists `{ pr, branch, mergeCommit, date }` in the
order they merged. The ship itself, `yad build done`, tidy and the epic seal are unchanged. Once the task has shipped,
`yad build merged` answers `shipped` for it, so a follow-up never competes with the task's own PR/MR, and
`yad build ship` refuses a follow-up PR as the task's ship. Before the task ships, a branch named like a
follow-up is the task's own only when no plain-named PR/MR for the task is open or merged — a task may be
about follow-ups (`…-T03-followup-reminders`). A follow-up is opened by a person:
`yad open-pr --via auto` refuses a task that has shipped.

This is the Build analogue of Shape's `approvals.json` — files only, no hidden state, so a
future service can drive ship by writing the same records. Like the trust log and build-state, it is a
machine-written ledger committed by **`yad checkpoint`** (the Build analogue of `yad gate` sync),
not by hand: after recording the ship, `yad checkpoint --push` lands the new `build-log/` shard as a
`chore(product): …` audit-trail commit on the default branch (allowlist-scoped to the Build ledgers,
never a Shape gate file); `yad tidy up` folds finished shards into `build-log.json` later.

### Retroactive ship — a pre-tracking story (#142)

A story that was merged and shipped **before** the Build ledger existed has no build-log ship, so
`yad checkpoint` can't carry its `status: shipped` flip (the flip is only carried when a ship backs it,
#112) — leaving a raw `git push origin main` as the only way to land it, against the never-raw-git
convention. To reconcile it through yad, record a **retroactive** ship, then checkpoint carries the flip
in the same commit:

```
yad checkpoint --retro-ship <epic>/<story> --repo <r> [--task <t>] [--merge-commit <sha>] [--push]
```

It writes ONE minimal ship shard marked `retroactive: true` (`task` defaults to the sentinel `retro`;
`mergeCommit` is written only if you pass `--merge-commit`; `shippedAt` is the backfill date), then runs
the normal checkpoint so the story's already-made `status:` flip rides along in the **same** commit. It
refuses when the story already has a ship **in that repo** (then it isn't pre-tracking there — use the
normal flow). It does **not** author the story frontmatter — and to keep evidence and the flip atomic (the no-drift
invariant), it **refuses** unless you have already set a Build `status:` (`in-build` or `shipped`) in
`stories/<story>.md`, so a ship shard is never committed while the artifact still says `approved`.

**Where the record lands — it is a shard, not an append to `build-log.json`.** Like every other ship, a
retroactive one is written to `.sdlc/build-log/` and the folded `build-log.json` is left untouched until
`yad tidy up` folds it. Opening `build-log.json` and finding nothing does **not** mean the write was lost:
read the ledger by the union rule above and the ship is there (#167). Note `tidy up` only folds a story
whose frontmatter is `shipped`, so a backfill recorded against an `in-build` story stays a loose shard
indefinitely — which is precisely why reading the folded file alone is never sufficient.

**One repo per run (#166).** A ship is recorded per `(story, task, repo)`, so a story that shipped in
several repos needs one retroactive shard **per repo** — the guard is keyed on `(story, repo)`, not on
the story alone, so recording the first repo never locks out the rest. Re-run once per repo:

```
yad checkpoint --retro-ship EP-foo/EP-foo-S01 --repo web --push
yad checkpoint --retro-ship EP-foo/EP-foo-S01 --repo api --push
```

The `status:` flip rides the **first** commit (it only needs one ship to be carried); each later run
lands only its own ship shard, so the story ends up with complete per-repo evidence. After each run the
command names the declared repos that still have none, so a half-finished backfill is visible instead of
looking complete.

A ship is permanent audit evidence, so `--repo` is checked before anything is written: it must be a repo
the story's `repos:` frontmatter declares (or, for a legacy story that declares none, one connected in
`.sdlc/repos.json`). A typo'd, mis-cased or invented name is **refused** — the per-repo guard means it
would otherwise collide with nothing and quietly record a ship for a repo that never existed. A name
that would share a shard **filename** with an already-recorded repo (shard names sanitize everything
outside `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` to `_`, so `api.v2` and `api_v2` are one file) is refused for the same reason:
recording it would overwrite the other repo's ship record in an append-only ledger.

Those checks decide from the ledger and then write it, so each one runs under an exclusive **lock** on
the epic's `build-log` — as does `yad review reconcile`'s stamp and `yad tidy up`'s fold. Two commands
writing the same ledger at once would otherwise both read "no ship yet" and both write. The lock is an
empty directory (`build-log.json.lock`), so git never sees it; one held by a process that died is
reclaimed after 30s, and a live one reports `YAD-STATE-006` rather than writing over the other's work.

**Engagement (the Review Companion).** Each `engineer_review` entry names the approver by platform login
(no role or domain) and carries `engagement: verified | none`
— `verified` when the engineer reviewed through the [companion](../../yad-review-companion/SKILL.md)
(`yad review trailer/context/nudge`, a real trailer/cards/chat session over the diff), `none` for a bare
approve. The optional `companion` block records which faces ran. It is **soft by default** (both count;
a bare approve draws a friendly `yad review nudge`); it only gates ship when
`review.requireEngagement: true` in the Product settings. `yad review reconcile --epic <id> --repo <r> --pr <n>` reads the
code PR's approvals (with the engagement signal) and stamps them onto the matching ship record — writing
back into the ship's shard where it lives (or its folded entry if the story was already tidied) — the
Build **bridge**, the analogue of `yad gate sync`. The signal is gameable by design ("visible, not
impossible"): it makes engineer-review quality visible, it does not prove a human read the diff. It sits
**beside** the CI gates (build/test/lint/contract/verified-commits) — never above them; CI still
decides machine safety, the merge is still the human act.

## Story state

The story frontmatter `status` reflects build progress:

- `in-build` — at least one, but not all, of the story's tasks (from `specs/<story>/tasks.md`) have ship
  records.
- `shipped` — **every** task in `tasks.md` has a ship record.

You write this flip into `stories/<story>.md`, but **do not hand-commit it** — the next
`yad checkpoint --push` carries it in the same `chore(product)` commit as the ledgers (the story now has a
build-log ship, so checkpoint stages it; #112). This is what keeps the story artifact from drifting
from the build ledger, so there is never a reason to fall back to a raw `git push origin main`.

So the chain is traceable both ways: from the epic down (`epic.md` → `stories/<story>.md` →
`tasks.md` → the build-ledger ship → `mergeCommit`) and from a merge commit back up (its `Task:`
trailer → story → epic). Resolve that ship by the union rule, not from `build-log.json` alone — until
`yad tidy up` folds it, the ship lives only in its `build-log/` shard and the chain looks broken.

## Preconditions for ship (all required)

1. The three **check gates** pass (Step C) — re-run them on the PR branch if unsure.
2. The **AI review** has run (advisory; findings surfaced to the engineer).
3. The **engineer review** base is met (1 distinct approver); any shortfall against the full count from
   the Impact & Risk block is reported, not blocking.

Only then does the human merge and `yad-engineer-review` record it. Nothing auto-advances.
