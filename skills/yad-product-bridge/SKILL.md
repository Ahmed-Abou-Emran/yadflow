description: 'The templated PR/MR bridge for the Shape review gate. When the Product has a platform (.sdlc/product.json), it opens a review PR/MR on the Product for an authored artifact (analysis / epic / architecture+contract / ui-design / stories / test-cases), applies the touched-domain labels (it requests no reviewers), and provides the read-only gh/glab recipes that yad-review-gate uses to pull platform comments + approvals back into the file ledger. Can also wire merge-time sync on the Product: a CI workflow that runs `yad gate ci` when a human merges a review PR/MR — CI is the sole ledger writer and writes only at merge, on the default branch (during review the platform PR/MR is the source of truth; CI never touches the review branch). Local-user auth only — no stored tokens. The file ledger stays the source of truth; degrades to the local gate when there is no platform / no CLI. Use when the user says "open the review PR", "route the review", "wire the gate sync", or it is invoked by yad-review-gate open/sync.'

# SDLC — Product Review Bridge (the templated PR/MR bridge)

**Goal:** Run the Shape review/comment/approval cycle through a **real PR/MR on the Product**,
without changing the gate's predicate or making the file ledger optional. The verified ledger is an **alternate
input path** into `yad-review-gate`: it opens a review PR for an artifact, reviewers approve/comment on
the platform with **their own** `gh`/`glab` auth, and the gate's `sync` action (which calls this skill's
read recipes) maps that platform state into `approvals.json` / `comments.json` / `reviews/*.md`, then
runs the **unchanged** predicate. The file ledger remains the source of truth.

This skill owns the **branch/PR mechanics + the gh/glab recipes** (mirroring how `yad-pr-template`
keeps platform mechanics out of the gate). `yad-review-gate` *calls* it; it never advances a step.

## Conventions

- `{project-root}` is the **Product**. The Product platform lives in `.sdlc/product.json` (written together with its older name `.sdlc/hub.json`, same bytes, until v5; read from `hub.json` only when `product.json` is absent) — it holds no
  list of people (`config.yaml` `product.config` (older projects: `hub.config`); schema in `../yad-connect-repos/references/product-config.md`).
- Per-step review-PR record: `epics/EP-<slug>/.sdlc/product-prs.json`, written together with its
  older name `hub-prs.json` (`config.yaml` `product.pr_ledger` (older projects: `hub.pr_ledger`)) — a
  sibling ledger to `approvals.json`, so `state.json`'s locked step shape is untouched.
- The review-PR body is the Product template from `yad-pr-template` (`templates/product/<platform>/…`).
- Branch per artifact: `review/EP-<slug>/<artifact-base>` (`config.yaml` `product.artifact_branch` (older projects: `hub.artifact_branch`)).
- **Local-user auth only; store no tokens.** Use the user's own `gh`/`glab`. If neither is installed/
  authenticated, STOP this path and tell the gate to fall back to local — never embed a credential.

## Inputs

- `epic`     — the `EP-<slug>` under review.
- `artifact` — the artifact file (`analysis.md` | `epic.md` | `architecture.md` | `ui-design.md` | `stories/` | `test-cases.md`).
- `action`   — `open` | `route` | `wire` (default `route`). (`sync`'s ledger writes live in
  `yad-review-gate`; this skill provides the read recipes `sync` calls — see `references/bridge.md`.)

## Preconditions (the verified ledger runs only when all hold)

`.sdlc/product.json` (or, on an older Product, `.sdlc/hub.json`) exists with a non-null `platform`, `ledger: "verified"` (or, before `yad migrate`, `bridge_enabled: true`), `config.yaml` `product.bridge: true`
(older projects: `hub.bridge: true`), and `gh` (GitHub) / `glab` (GitLab) installed **and authenticated**. If any fails, report that the
gate proceeds **local** (no error) and stop.

## On Activation

### Step 1 — Resolve platform + routing
Read `.sdlc/product.json` (`.sdlc/hub.json` on an older Product that has only that name) for the platform, `epics/<epic>/epic.md` for `repos` + `owner` (the artifact's
author), and the matching `review+approve` step's `risk_tags` from `.sdlc/state.json`. Compute the
**count** with `route` (below) — the same rule `yad-review-gate` enforces: `needed = base 1 + risk step`
distinct approvers, where `contract` adds 2 and `auth`/`payments` add 1 (the highest tag, never the sum).
Only the base (1 distinct approver, who should not be the author) holds the gate; the risk step is
advisory. The gate caps the count at the active people less one and prints it (E72), but does
not enforce it yet; when it cannot count the people — as in Product CI, which checks out only the Product —
no cap is shown. Compute the **touched domains** too: the union of story `repos` for
`stories-review`, the epic's `repos` for a step tagged `contract`, `auth` or `payments`, none otherwise.
They become `domain:<repo>` labels and
are a hint for whom to ask. There is no roster to turn them into people.

### Step 2 — `open` (create the review PR/MR)
1. From the Product default branch, create `review/EP-<slug>/<artifact-base>` and ensure the artifact file
   (and, for architecture, `contract.md` + `.sdlc/contract-lock.json`) is committed on it — by the step's
   `yad fold` commit (E44); `yad open-pr` warns when the step's files have changes no fold has committed. Push as the
   local user. **First gate of a new epic:** cut the review branch from the **authoring** branch
   (`epic/…`, `change/…`, `analysis/…`, `discovery/…`) instead, so it carries the `.sdlc/` **seed** —
   that PR/MR is the only way a new epic's ledger reaches the default branch, and `ledger-guard`
   exempts it (see step 4).
2. Open the PR/MR with `gh`/`glab` using the Product body template (`yad-pr-template` `templates/product/…`),
   filled with the epic, artifact, gate step, owner, `epic.repos`, and the step's risk tags.
3. **Request no reviewers.** Assign the person opening it — `@me` on GitHub (`gh` resolves it), the
   login `glab api user` reports on GitLab (no assignee when that lookup fails) — and add a
   `domain:<repo>` label per touched repo. `yad gate open` prints
   `no reviewers were requested — ask them on the PR itself`; the author asks people on the PR. (A Shape review PR gets no
   reviewer suggestion: E68's suggestion reads a code change, so only `yad open-pr` (and `yad ship`) on a code repo prints it.)
4. **Do not write the ledger.** CI is the sole writer and writes only at merge. During review nothing
   is recorded in the ledger — the platform PR/MR holds the review state (native approvals + threads).
   At merge, CI records the PR-ledger entry in the shape below (in `product-prs.json` and `hub-prs.json`) and advances on the default
   branch:
   ```json
   { "step": "<review step id>", "artifact": "<artifact>", "platform": "github|gitlab",
     "number": <n>, "url": "<pr/mr url>", "branch": "review/EP-<slug>/<artifact-base>", "lastSyncedAt": null }
   ```
   A human commit touching the gate-state files (`.sdlc/{state,approvals,comments,product-prs,hub-prs}.json` or
   `reviews/*.md`; `.sdlc/contract-lock.json` is artifact-side and allowed) on a review PR is rejected
   by the `ledger-guard` check. (The `yad gate open` CLI behaves the same: in verified mode it opens the
   PR only and writes no ledger.) The **one** exception is a brand-new epic's **seed** — no CI path can
   create a ledger, so an epic whose `.sdlc/state.json` is absent from the base ref may be created by a
   human on this first PR/MR (#162). Every later change to it is CI's alone.
5. Report the PR/MR URL and the count the step needs. **Do not** record approvals or advance — reviewers
   act on the platform; CI (`yad gate ci`) reconciles it onto the default branch at merge.

### Step 3 — `route` (print the count)
Compute and print the count as above. Use `templates/checks/product-route.sh <body>` to parse a PR/MR
body's Impact & Risk block when given one; it prints e.g. `ROUTE: 3 approvers = base 1 + contract risk 2
(risk tag: contract)`, says only the base holds the gate (1 approval), that the risk step is advisory
and `yad gate status` prints it capped by the active people, and lists the touched repos as a hint for whom
to ask. With no `contract`/`auth`/`payments` tag it prints `ROUTE: 1 approver = base 1 (no risk step).`
and no repo list. Otherwise derive from
`epic.repos` + the step's `risk_tags`. Stories do not route per repo. Advisory only — it routes the
human review, it does not approve.

### Step 4 — `wire` (merge-time sync on the Product)
Install the Product CI that turns the human **merge** into a `yad gate ci` run, with CI as the **sole
writer** of the ledger. There is no pre-merge CI write — during review the platform PR/MR is the
source of truth (native approvals + threads). On merge, CI re-reads approvals from the platform,
advances the step, and flips the artifact `status:` on the **default branch** (the only place CI ever
commits). Also install the `ledger-guard` check (yad-checks) so humans cannot commit gate-state files,
and its local counterpart `hooks/ledger-guard.mjs` — the harness hook that refuses an **agent** the
same write at the moment it tries it, instead of letting it surface as a CI failure later (#171).
Revoke-on-change is enforced at merge: on **GitHub** in code (an approval whose commit ≠ the merged
head is dropped — no setting needed); on **GitLab** it has no per-approval commit SHA, so enabling the
platform's **"remove all approvals when commits are added to the source branch"** is **required** for
the guarantee. Either way it is safe because CI never pushes the review branch — only the owner's own
artifact pushes dismiss approvals. In verified mode `yad gate sync` is advisory (read-only) and is **not**
a recovery path; if a merge-time run fails, the scheduled reconcile job re-advances it automatically, or
a maintainer can force it with `yad gate ci --branch <review-branch> --pr <n> --merged` locally on the
default branch. (local mode keeps `yad gate sync` as the local writer.)

1. Run `yad check --fix` (the wiring is manifest-driven, like `yad-checks`): with a platform +
   enabled bridge in `.sdlc/product.json` it installs
   - GitHub → `.github/workflows/yad-gate-sync.yml` (from `templates/github/yad-gate-sync.yml`)
   - GitLab → `.gitlab/ci/yad-gate-sync.yml` (from `templates/gitlab/yad-gate-sync.gitlab-ci.yml`)
   - plus the Product-side **verified-commits** gate (`checks/verified-commits.sh` + its workflow/fragment,
     owned by `yad-checks`) so review PRs accept only platform-Verified (signed) commits — there is no
     author allowlist
   - the wired job runs an **exact** version, resolved at run time from the repo: the `YAD_VERSION`
     variable, else `product.json` `gate_sync_version` (`hub.json` when it is absent), else the `.sdlc/cli-version.json` stamp, else the
     floating major the fragment ships with (`YAD_MAJOR`, `4` in this release) — a committed pin is used
     only when it is an exact release of that major, so `yad update` moves the fragment and the stamp
     to a new major together. It stopped floating on the major because that let a release change a scheduled job's
     behaviour unattended — how #163's churn reached Products that never opted in. So upgrading is now a
     deliberate act (`yad update`); if the resolved pin predates 3.15.3, upgrade or disable the
     schedule. Never edit a version into the wired file — `yad check --fix` rewrites it byte-for-byte
     from the template. See `references/bridge.md`.
2. **GitLab only — two one-time steps** (see the fragment's header for the exact recipes):
   - add `include: - local: '.gitlab/ci/yad-gate-sync.yml'` to the root `.gitlab-ci.yml`, or write
     `templates/gitlab/gitlab-ci.include-root.yml` as the root when none exists;
   - create the 15-minute pipeline **schedule** (variable `SDLC_GATE_SYNC=true`) and the masked
     `SDLC_GATE_TOKEN` project-access-token variable (`read_api` + `write_repository`). GitLab fires no
     pipeline on an approval alone, and a squash merge can drop the branch name, so the schedule is the
     catch-up path that advances merged reviews it discovers via the API (≤ ~15 min latency); a merge
     push whose commit names the review branch advances near-immediately.
   - **If your runners are tag-locked** (`run_untagged: false`, common on self-hosted): set a
     `YAD_RUNNER_TAGS` CI/CD variable (e.g. `dind_runner`) so the docker-image `yad-gate-sync` job
     is routed to a runner — otherwise it sits `pending` forever. The fragment emits
     `tags: [$YAD_RUNNER_TAGS]`. When unset, current GitLab (≥15) drops the empty-expanded tag so the
     job runs untagged (gitlab.com shared runners); older versions may strand it `pending`, in which
     case set the variable to a real tag. The variable lives in project settings, so it survives
     every `yad` sync. Single value only — `tags: [$VAR]` is one tag equal to the whole variable,
     not a comma-split.
   - **The Node line** (#364): the job runs `image: node:${YAD_NODE_VERSION}`, `22` by default; set a
     `YAD_NODE_VERSION` CI/CD variable to change it without editing the managed fragment. Leave
     **Protect variable** unticked on it and on `YAD_RUNNER_TAGS` unless only protected branches run
     yad jobs — a protected variable never reaches an unprotected branch's pipeline. A
     **shell-executor** runner ignores `image:`: the job then runs on the runner host, which needs
     `bash`, `git`, `curl` and Node with `npx` on the runner user's `PATH`. The job also installs a
     pinned `glab` package with `dpkg -i` (root) and puts `jq` (and `git-lfs` when the Product uses LFS)
     in `/usr/local/bin`, all `linux_amd64` builds — so a shell runner must be an x86-64 Debian-family
     host whose runner user may do that; otherwise use a docker executor for this job. `yad doctor` warns on a fragment that still runs a
     fixed `node:<n>` image (`YAD-CI-002`); `yad update` replaces it.
   - **Git LFS needs nothing extra.** For a Product that uses Git LFS, the runner installs LFS git
     hooks that fail without `git-lfs`, and the job's node image has none — so the job downloads a
     pinned `git-lfs` itself before its checkout (#327; a Product without LFS skips it). A
     `before_script` added by hand to install `git-lfs` can be removed after `yad update`.
3. Commit the workflow to the Product. GitHub needs nothing else — the ephemeral `github.token` reads the
   PR and pushes the merge advance to the default branch, and the workflow's reconcile **schedule**
   runs automatically (no setup) as the safety net that recovers a merge whose run failed transiently.
   If the default branch is protected, see the workflow header for the bypass / PAT options; until then
   the run fails visibly — recover by granting the push path, then re-run the workflow or run
   `yad gate ci --branch <review-branch> --pr <n> --merged` locally on the default branch (advisory
   `yad gate sync` cannot recover a bridge gate).

## Hard rules

- **Local-user auth only; store no tokens.** Reviewers use their own `gh`/`glab`.
- **the verified ledger is an input path, never the authority.** It opens PRs and reads state; the **file ledger
  is the source of truth** and the gate predicate (in `yad-review-gate`) is unchanged.
- **the verified ledger never approves on a reviewer's behalf.** Reviewers approve/merge with their own auth. The
  step advances when a human **merges** the approved, fully-resolved review PR (the merge is that human
  act) — `yad gate ci` at merge (or `yad gate sync` with a local ledger) records the approvals +
  resolution + merged state and advances; unresolved
  comments or a changed artifact hold it `in_review`. The mechanical sync is the `yad gate` CLI.
- **CI never approves and never merges.** The wired workflow only runs `gate ci` — the same sync +
  unchanged predicate. It does **nothing pre-merge** (the platform PR/MR holds the review state); at
  merge it re-reads approvals from the platform, advances the step, and flips the artifact status on
  the **default branch** (the only place CI ever commits). CI is the sole ledger writer; Shape gates
  stay permanently human.
- **The CI tokens are the one documented bend of "no stored tokens".** GitHub uses the platform's own
  ephemeral `github.token` (nothing stored). GitLab requires a stored masked `SDLC_GATE_TOKEN`
  project access token because `CI_JOB_TOKEN` can neither read the approvals API nor push — say so
  when wiring, and scope it to `read_api` + `write_repository` only.
- **Protect the Product default branch.** Require that `epics/**` artifacts change only through a review
  PR/MR (branch protection). This keeps revoke-on-change sound: it removes the only window where a
  delayed reconcile could advance on an out-of-band post-merge artifact change (see `references/bridge.md`,
  "Known limitation"). Safe to require: a new epic's `.sdlc/` seed rides its first review PR/MR, so
  nobody needs a direct push to the default branch to start an epic (#162).
- **Degrade gracefully.** No platform / disabled bridge / no CLI → the gate runs local with no error.
