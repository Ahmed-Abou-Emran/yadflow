# the verified ledger — PR/MR ↔ ledger mapping, read recipes, idempotency

the verified ledger maps platform review state onto the **same file records** the manual gate writes, so the gate
predicate (`../yad-review-gate/references/gating.md`) runs unchanged. The verified ledger only changes the
*input path*; it never changes what passing the gate means.

## State mapping (platform → ledger)

| Platform review state | Ledger effect |
|---|---|
| GitHub review `APPROVED` / GitLab MR approval (`approved_by`) | one `approved` record per person in `approvals.json`, `approver` = the platform login, no role, tagged `"source": "bridge"` |
| GitHub `COMMENTED` / `CHANGES_REQUESTED`; GitLab discussions/notes | a line under `## <login> (unresolved)` or `## <login> (changes requested — **blocking**)` in `reviews/<artifact>--<date>--comments.md` + a `comments.json` record (`commenter` = the login); **never** an approval. `CHANGES_REQUESTED` is also flagged as blocking in the comments file |
| GitHub review dismissed / GitLab approval revoked | the prior bridge `approved` record for that approver is removed on re-sync **while the step is open**; once the step is `done` the record is kept as the audit trail of why it passed (see idempotency) |

`approvals.json` records from the verified ledger carry `"source": "bridge"`; **manual** approvals have no such
tag and are **never** touched by `sync` — the two coexist.

## Read recipes (read-only, local-user auth — no tokens)

**GitHub** (`gh`, the reviewer/runner's own auth):
```
gh pr view <n> --json reviews,comments,reviewDecision,latestReviews
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}/comments        # inline review comments
```
- `reviews[].state` ∈ {APPROVED, CHANGES_REQUESTED, COMMENTED, DISMISSED}; `reviews[].author.login` is
  the login written to the record. Use `latestReviews` so a superseded earlier review doesn't double-count.

**GitLab** (`glab` / `glab api`):
```
glab mr view <n>
glab api projects/:id/merge_requests/:iid/approvals     # approved_by[].user.username
glab api projects/:id/merge_requests/:iid/discussions    # discussions + their notes (comments, resolvable threads)
```

All commands run as the **local user**; the verified ledger stores no tokens. If the CLI is missing/unauthenticated
or the remote is unreachable, the verified ledger stops and the gate falls back to local (no error).

> **GitLab read parity (GAP-6).** `readPrGitLab` reads approvals (`approved_by[]`) and discussions but
> does **not** map a "Request changes" reviewer state to `CHANGES_REQUESTED` — on GitLab the blocking
> signal is an **unresolved discussion**. So on GitLab the gate is held by unresolved threads, not by a
> reviewer state. (GitHub maps both.) If you need GitLab "Request changes" honored, read
> `reviewers[].state` from the MR and map it to `CHANGES_REQUESTED`.

## Open recipes (no reviewers requested — used by `yad gate open` / `yad open-pr`)

Opening the review PR/MR **requests no reviewers**. yadflow keeps no list of people to pick them from
(E62), so the command prints `no reviewers were requested — ask them on the PR itself`, and the author
asks people on the PR. (On a code-repo PR, `yad open-pr` also prints a reviewer suggestion from recent history and CODEOWNERS — E68, a hint, never a request.) `yad gate open` assigns the opener and adds the touched-domain labels (`domain:<repo>`); `yad open-pr`
assigns the opener and adds no labels. An agent opening a PR by hand
uses:

**GitHub:**
```bash
gh pr create --title "review: <artifact> (<epic>)" --body <body> --base <default> --head <branch> \
  --assignee <login|@me> --label domain:<repo>
```

**GitLab:**
```bash
glab mr create --title "review: <artifact> (<epic>)" --description <body> \
  --target-branch <default> --source-branch <branch> --assignee <login> --label domain:<repo> --yes
```

The assignee is `@me` on GitHub (`gh` resolves it on the repo's host) and the login `glab api user`
reports on GitLab (none when that lookup fails). The `domain:<repo>` labels are the touched domains —
for `stories-review` the union of every story's `repos`, for a step tagged `contract`, `auth` or
`payments` the epic's `repos`, and none otherwise. They are a hint for whom to ask and add no
approvals.

## Who a record names

The platform login that reviewed is written as `approver` / `commenter`. There is no lookup and no
role, and no login is flagged `unverified`: the platform's record of who approved is the evidence, and
repository access decides who may approve. A review with no login is not counted.

(Full detail, including older roster-era records and the `by` field: `login-roster.md`.)

## Idempotent re-sync

- Key bridge approvals on `(step, approver)` — one record per person. On re-sync, **upsert** — do not
  append a duplicate. An older record that still carries `role`/`domain` (and may name the person by
  their old roster name) is recognised as `login-roster.md` → "Older records" describes (the roster's
  name → login pairs first; never by list order), and replaced by one login-named record that keeps its
  `artifactHash` and dates — unless the platform shows a newer review (a later submission time, with a
  time on both sides, or a different PR/MR), which, as for any approval, binds to the current content.
  Every sync write (`yad gate sync`, `yad gate ci`) also records the login on the older records the
  roster can place for certain, on every step of the epic; only the records it cannot place still need the
  roster on a later sync (`login-roster.md` → "Recording the login on older
  records").
- A bridge approval records the platform's evidence when it is given: `approvedAt` (GitHub's submission
  time, GitLab's `approved_at`), and on GitHub the review's `commit`, `url` and `reviewId`. They are
  audit only — the gate decides on the login and the fingerprint. A stored `approvedAt` that is only a
  date (every GitLab record from before this) is "time unknown": it keeps its fingerprint and takes the
  platform's time once.
- **On an OPEN step**, remove any bridge approval whose platform review was dismissed/revoked: the
  platform is the live source of truth while the review is in flight.
- **On a step already `done`**, the record is only added to or refreshed in place — an approval the
  platform no longer reports is **kept**. Those approvals are the audit record of *why* the gate
  passed; an approval reset, or a degraded-but-successful read would otherwise erase
  them and leave the step `done` with zero approvals.
- Record synced comments as one `comments.json` record per `(step, commenter, round)` with a `count`
  (there is no per-comment id). A new round is opened only when the commenters or their counts change;
  an unchanged re-read rewrites the latest round in place, keeping its date. Comment rounds are recorded
  for an **open** step only, so re-visiting a merged review does not append a new round per pass.
- Update the step's PR-ledger `lastSyncedAt` (`product-prs.json` + `hub-prs.json`, same bytes) when the sync **learned something** — on an open
  step when its approvals, comment rounds, step state or nudges changed (or it was never synced), and on
  a closed one only when the approval record actually changed (a re-opened review that was re-approved).
  An identical re-sync leaves it alone, so the ledger does not churn (issue #362).
- **Write the ledgers in a canonical order.** `approvals.json`, `comments.json` and the PR ledger
  (`product-prs.json` + `hub-prs.json`, written together) are
  sorted on write, so the bytes are a function of the record *set* and never of which step was synced
  last. Without this the upsert above — which drops the records it refreshes and re-appends them at the
  tail — makes the file depend on sync order, and the wired sweep (one `gate ci --branch <ref>
  --merged` per merged PR/MR, every 15 minutes) walks a rotation:
  `[A,B,C] → sync A → [B,C,A] → sync B → [C,A,B] → sync C → [A,B,C]`. Every hop is a non-empty diff, so
  every hop commits and pushes, and the pass ends where it began — an unbounded commit loop with zero
  semantic change. That is issue #163: ~1,800 bot commits/day on the Product that reported it. Sorting is
  what makes the "nothing staged → nothing to commit" guard in `gate ci` actually hold.
- **Move the PR pointer back to an older review only when it passes the gate.** The PR ledger holds ONE pointer per
  artifact, but the sweep can find several merged reviews for one artifact: a re-review on a fresh
  PR/MR, or per-story `review/<epic>/stories-S01`, `stories-S02` branches, which all map to `stories/`.
  On a merge run, `gate ci` keeps the pointer when the PR/MR it was given has a lower number than the
  recorded one (numbers only grow within one repo), and syncs the recorded one instead. A newer review
  still moves it forward, so a re-review of a done step is still read (#156). Merges happen in any
  order, so on a step that is still open the older review is first read in a dry run: if it passes the
  gate, the pointer moves back to it once and the step advances (a held newer review cannot block an
  approved older one, and the manual recovery still works). A pointer from another platform never
  counts as newer, and before the pointer moves to a number it has never held, `gate ci` asks the
  platform that the PR/MR is on the review branch — a mistyped `--pr` the platform places on another
  branch is refused, not recorded. The dry run prints nothing; if its platform read fails, the run
  goes red and says the older review could not be checked. Before this, each visit
  moved the pointer to its own PR/MR — done step or not — a real diff every 15 minutes for 7 days,
  committed as "advance … on merge" (issue #362: about 24,400 such commits on the Product that reported it). The commit subject now says
  `advance … on merge` only when a step really advanced; any other merge-run change says `sync … after merge`.
- Running `sync` again with no platform change is a no-op on the ledger — byte-identical, including
  `comments.json` and the dated `reviews/*.md` side files — on the same day or a later one. A review's
  `lastSyncedAt` and its dated side files move only when its approvals, comment rounds, step state or
  nudges changed (issue #362: a merged review the gate still held used to commit a new date and a new
  dated file every day of the 7-day sweep window).

**Upgrading past #163.** The first sweep on a yadflow carrying the fix writes one canonicalizing
reorder commit per epic (the records are the same; only their order changes), then converges
permanently. On an older yadflow the workaround is to disable the pipeline schedule — merges still
advance gates via the push path; only the catch-up for squash merges and bare approvals is lost.
Since the wired job now runs an exact pin rather than floating on the major, that upgrade is a
deliberate act: `yad update` (which re-stamps `.sdlc/cli-version.json`), or a `gate_sync_version` in
`.sdlc/product.json` — see the version table below.

## Contract re-lock invalidates prior platform approvals too

For the **architecture+contract** review, an approval's `artifactHash` is the contract-surface hash.
When the surface changes and is re-locked, a bridge approval recorded against the old hash no longer
matches, so the gate stops counting it (it shows as stale in `yad gate status`) — exactly as for a
manual approval. Nothing is deleted by date and no comment is posted on the PR; the reviewer approves
again, and a genuinely newer review (a later submission time, or a new PR/MR) binds to the new hash. The count
(`risk_tags: ["contract"]` → 3 approvers, capped at the active people less one and reported; base 1
enforced, risk step advisory) is unchanged.

## CHANGES_REQUESTED & unresolved threads hold the gate

`CHANGES_REQUESTED` and any **unresolved review thread** are recorded as comments and surfaced as
**blocking**. Under the PR-driven gate they actively hold the step `in_review`: the predicate does not
pass while any thread is unresolved, even if the approval count is met. The owner addresses the
comments, replies, the reviewer **resolves** their thread, then `sync` runs again.

## Merge advances; an artifact change revokes approvals

- **Merge → advance.** When the base count is met (1 distinct approver; the capped risk step is reported, not enforced; solo mode waives it), every thread is resolved, **and the review
  PR/MR is merged**, `sync` marks the step `done` and unblocks the next step. The merge is the human
  approval act — there is no separate machine advance. (`yad gate sync` performs this deterministically.)
- **Revoke on artifact change (checked at merge).** Path B reconciles at merge, so an approval given
  to an earlier revision must not count for the merged content. How that is enforced differs by
  platform:
  - **GitHub — in code.** Each approval carries the **commit SHA it was made on**; `mapApprovers`
    drops any approval whose commit ≠ the merged head (`headOid`). The reviewer approved an older
    revision → their review is stale → dropped. No platform setting required.
  - **GitLab — platform setting.** GitLab approvals expose no per-approval commit SHA (the reader omits
    it), so the in-code SHA check does not apply and the approval is kept. Revoke-on-change there is the
    platform's **"remove all approvals when commits are added to the source branch"** setting — **enable
    it** (required for the guarantee on GitLab; safe under Path B because CI never pushes the source
    branch, so only the owner's own artifact pushes drop approvals).
  - **Degraded GitHub read — fail closed.** If the GitHub commit read fails (the reader returns a
    `null` commit), the approval is **dropped**: a transient failure holds the gate rather than
    advancing on approvals whose freshness cannot be proven (re-run `yad gate sync` to recover).
    CHANGES_REQUESTED is still honored, so a degraded read can only ever *hold* the gate.
  The `artifactHash` stamp still binds architecture approvals to the locked contract surface (see
  "Contract re-lock" above). For every other artifact it covers the file WITHOUT its frontmatter
  `status:` line, so the merge run's own `draft` → `approved` flip (and Build's `in-build` / `shipped`)
  never revokes the approvals it just recorded (shape 9). An approval recorded before shape 9 hashed the
  whole file, and is still read.
- **Known limitation — protect the Product default branch.** The advance hashes the artifact from the
  default branch as it stands when CI runs, while approvals are SHA-bound to the reviewed PR/MR head.
  Those can differ if the artifact changes on the **base** outside this review while the PR/MR is open
  (the merge then integrates a change the reviewers never saw) or if a later out-of-band commit edits
  the merged artifact before a delayed reconcile advances it. In both cases each approval's commit
  still equals the reviewed head, so the SHA check passes, yet the live content was not reviewed. Close
  it operationally: **require branch protection on the Product default branch so `epics/**` artifacts can
  only change through their own review PR/MR** (one open review per artifact) — then the base copy of an
  artifact cannot move while its review is open, so the merged/live content always equals the reviewed
  content. (The complete in-code fix would hash the artifact at the reviewed PR-head revision before
  advancing; deferred in favor of the branch-protection mitigation.)

## Event-driven sync (Product CI) — Path B

The `wire` action (SKILL.md Step 4) installs CI on the Product so a **merge** drives `yad gate ci` —
**CI is the SOLE writer of the ledger, and it writes only at merge, only to the default branch.**
During review CI writes nothing: the platform PR/MR is the source of truth (native approvals +
threads). The CLI is self-sufficient at merge: it derives the epic + artifact from the
`review/EP-<slug>/<artifact-base>` head branch, takes the PR/MR number from the event (GitHub) or
resolves it from the platform (GitLab), upserts the PR-ledger entry itself (under both names), and **re-reads
approvals fresh from the platform** — so no ledger needs to be pre-seeded on the branch. (It only
*advances* a chain, though: it cannot **create** one. A brand-new epic's seed therefore travels the
other way — up through its first review PR/MR; see "the seed of a new epic" below.)

| Platform event | Phase | CI action |
|---|---|---|
| PR/MR opened / reopened / pushed / reviewed | pre-merge | **none** — review state lives on the platform; CI never touches the branch |
| PR/MR closed **and merged** (the human act) | merge | `gate ci --branch <head> --pr <n> --merged` → re-read approvals, advance the step + flip the artifact `status:` **on the default branch** |
| Schedule (`*/15`) | reconcile | Safety net: enumerate recently-**merged** `review/EP-*` PRs/MRs via the API and advance any not yet `done` (idempotent). Recovers a merge whose merge-time run failed transiently, and on GitLab also picks up a squash merge whose commit dropped the branch name (and a bare approval — GitLab fires no pipeline on one). **GitHub:** a scheduled workflow, automatic once committed. **GitLab:** a pipeline schedule with `SDLC_GATE_SYNC=true` (one-time setup) |

**Which yadflow the wired job runs.** Both fragments resolve the version from a `YAD_VERSION` variable
and fall back to the major the fragment ships with — `YAD_MAJOR` in its `yad-pin` block (`4` in this release):

| # | Source | Set it in |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `YAD_VERSION` — used **verbatim**, the operator's override | GitHub: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → **Variables**. GitLab: Settings → CI/CD → **Variables** (beside `SDLC_GATE_TOKEN`) |
| 2 | `.sdlc/product.json` → `gate_sync_version` (`.sdlc/hub.json` when `product.json` is absent) — this Product's committed pin | edit `product.json`, run `yad migrate --apply --keep product` (it copies it over `hub.json`; two that differ are refused, YAD-STATE-008), commit both. A Product that has only `hub.json`: edit that, and never create a `product.json` beside it by hand |
| 3 | `.sdlc/cli-version.json` → `version` — the yadflow that last wired the Product | `yad update` re-stamps it |
| 4 | `$YAD_MAJOR` — floating major, only when nothing above resolves. While only prereleases of that major exist (`4.0.0-next.N`) npm cannot resolve a bare major, so the job says so on stderr first; a Product wired by that release always has a stamp that resolves | — |

Sources 2 and 3 are **validated** before use: an exact release token of the fragment's own major, prereleases
included (`4.16.0-rc.1` is a legitimate pin; `latest`, a bare `4` and a `3.x` are not). A `.sdlc/cli-version.json`
written by a long-untouched project can still say something like `1.0.2`, a version with no `yad gate ci`
in it at all, and the value is interpolated into `npx -p "yadflow@$V"` on a runner holding a push token —
so anything that is not an exact release of this major is skipped, loudly, in favour of the next source.
`YAD_VERSION` is exempt: it is a human's deliberate act, and it is the only way to cross a major.

**A new major moves both files at once.** `yad update` rewrites the fragment from the release's template
and re-stamps `.sdlc/cli-version.json` in the same run, so a Product that updates to 4.x gets a fragment
with `YAD_MAJOR=4` and a `4.x` stamp together. A `gate_sync_version` pin in `product.json` from the old major
is then SKIPPED (the job logs `ignoring pin … not an exact 4.x release`) — update it or remove it (edit
`product.json`, then `yad migrate --apply --keep product`; on a Product that has only `hub.json`, edit that). A
fragment the team EDITED is kept by `yad update` while the stamp still moves, so an edited fragment on
the old major would skip the new stamp; `yad update` names that case, and `--overwrite-local` replaces
the fragment (saving the edit beside it). The
fragment's major is held to the major a release publishes by `scripts/pin-major-check.sh`, a step of the
release check.

**Why this is no longer a floating major.** It used to be, on the argument that a published fix should
reach a scheduled job with nobody in the loop — this page's own issue #163 as the example. The same
mechanism is how #163's churn *arrived*: the CI fragment ran `yadflow@3`, so 3.13.1 rolled onto every
wired Product automatically and took the reporting one from 20 to 96 churn commits an hour, with nobody
deciding to upgrade. Issue #163's fourth suggested fix was to stop that. The trade-off is real and cuts
both ways — a Product is no longer carried onto a fix for free, so **if the resolved pin is older than
3.15.3, run `yad update` or disable the schedule** (`yad doctor` flags a stale stamp).

The pin is **never stamped into the wired file**: `yad` owns that file and `yad check --fix` rewrites it
byte-for-byte from the template, so a version edited into it would report `outdated` on every check and
be reverted on the next sync. That is exactly why the job resolves it from committed files at run time
instead — the fragment itself stays byte-identical to what ships.

**Why no pre-merge write fixes the gate.** Keeping CI off the PR head means an in-flight approval is
never dismissed by a CI commit, and the PR's required checks never strand on a `[skip ci]` CI commit.
Correctness is unaffected: at merge CI re-reads the PR/MR approvals from the platform and re-checks
each `artifactHash` against the merged content, so revoke-on-change still holds. The only ledger
commit — the advance plus the `draft → approved` status flip — lands on the **default branch** with
`[skip ci]`.

**The ledger is CI-owned (verified mode only).** Humans never commit gate-state files: the `ledger-guard`
check (yad-checks) FAILs any commit on a review PR that touches `.sdlc/{state,approvals,comments,product-prs,hub-prs}
.json` or `reviews/*.md` (`.sdlc/contract-lock.json` is artifact-side and allowed). "verified mode" there
means the same thing it means everywhere else — a `platform` **and** the verified ledger flag, `isVerifiedLedger`'s
predicate. The gate used to enable itself on the flag alone, which let a platform-less Product reject the
human's ledger write while the CLI still expected one (#186). Under Path B **no
CI commit lands in a review PR at all**, so the only ledger change the guard can see there is a human
edit — which it rejects, with one carve-out for a new epic's seed (below). (The `verified-commits`
gate still vets every commit's platform-Verified signature — there is no author allowlist, and so no
gate-bot exemption either.) `yad gate open`
opens the PR only; local `yad gate sync` is advisory in verified mode (writes nothing). After a merge,
everyone `git checkout <default> && git pull`. (with a local ledger, humans own the ledger locally and
these guards are no-ops.)

**The one sanctioned human ledger write *in a review PR*: the seed of a new epic.** `gate ci` only
**advances** an existing chain — it bails on a missing `state.json`, and the engine reads that absence
as "not seeded yet" — so no CI path can ever create a ledger. The seed the authoring skills write
(`yad-epic`, `yad-change`, `yad-analysis`, `yad-discovery`, `yad-stub`) can reach the default branch
only through the epic's **first** review PR/MR, which is exactly where `ledger-guard` runs. So the gate
exempts **creation**: an epic whose `.sdlc/state.json` is absent from the PR's base ref may have its
ledger written by a human there (#162). It stays a narrow carve-out — the probe is against the base
ref, not the parent commit, so deleting an on-trunk `state.json` to "re-seed" it is itself a rejected
mutation, and the moment the ledger is on the default branch every further change is CI's alone. Cut
that first review branch from the authoring branch (`epic/…`, `change/…`) so it carries the seed; no
direct push to a protected default branch is needed.

**The one sanctioned human ledger write *on the default branch*: `yad gate repair`.** It heals a `YAD-STATE-005` chain (an
authoring step stranded behind a review gate that already advanced) by writing `state.json` alone. This
is not a `ledger-guard` gap: the repair commits to the **default branch**, where `ledger-guard` — which
only inspects review PRs — never runs, and where the `yad-update-guard` (platform-Verified signature)
vets it instead, exactly as it does for `yad checkpoint` and `yad update`.
The command refuses to commit off the default branch unless `--allow-branch` is passed.

**Loop prevention & races.** The only ledger commit lands on the **default branch** at merge, which
fires no PR trigger; it carries `[skip ci]` to guard sibling workflows. Because CI never pushes the
review branch, there is no `synchronize` / MR-pipeline loop to prevent — and it is now **safe to enable**
the platform's **"dismiss stale approvals on push"** (GitHub) / **"remove all approvals when commits
are added to the source branch"** (GitLab): only the owner's own artifact pushes dismiss approvals,
which is exactly the intended revoke-on-change. Merge advances serialize on the default branch; the
push retries with a rebase.

**Tokens.**
- GitHub: the ephemeral `github.token` — nothing stored. The workflow default is `contents: read`; the
  two jobs that push (merge and reconcile) each ask for `contents: write` + `pull-requests: read`, and
  push only the default branch.
- GitLab: a masked `SDLC_GATE_TOKEN` project access token (`read_api` + `write_repository`) — the one
  documented bend of the no-stored-tokens rule; `CI_JOB_TOKEN` can neither read the approvals API nor
  push. Used only for the merge-time default-branch push + the API reads.
- Protected default branch (GitHub): the merge advance needs to push it, and the built-in Actions token
  cannot bypass branch protection or a ruleset (a ruleset's bypass list takes actors such as roles,
  teams and GitHub Apps, never GitHub Actions). Pass a token whose owner may bypass to both jobs' `actions/checkout` — a GitHub
  App on the bypass list, or a fine-grained PAT as `SDLC_GATE_TOKEN`. See yadflow's
  `docs/branch-protection.md`.

**Manual sync & recovery.** In verified mode `yad gate sync` is **advisory** (read-only) — it prints the
predicate (and any `! may not be met:` / `! if the risk step were enforced:` warning, E73) but writes
nothing, so it is **not** a recovery path when CI fails. If a merge-time run fails
(can't push, API hiccup), recovery is the scheduled **reconcile** job (automatic; it re-advances merged
reviews not yet `done`). To force it immediately, a maintainer runs the same command CI runs, locally on
the default branch: `yad gate ci --branch <review-branch> --pr <n> --merged` (this writes + pushes,
unlike advisory `yad gate sync`). Local mode (no platform) keeps `yad gate sync` as the local writer.
The file ledger is still the source of truth.

Because CI records the PR-ledger pointer (`product-prs.json` + `hub-prs.json`) only at merge, a review the ledger has never seen still
has to be nameable — otherwise `sync` refuses a PR that is sitting merged on the platform. With no
recorded pointer, `yad gate sync <epic> <artifact>` resolves the PR/MR from the review branch
(`review/<epic>/<artifact>`) itself, and `--pr <n>` names it outright:

```bash
yad gate sync EP-x architecture.md --pr 42   # advisory in verified mode; the writer with a local ledger
```

An explicit `--pr` also **overrides** a recorded pointer, since a re-opened review is a new PR the
ledger has not seen. Before its reviewers are bound to the artifact's hash, the number is confirmed to
be the PR for that artifact's review branch — a mismatch is refused, and a platform that cannot answer
warns and proceeds. The verified ledger rule is unchanged: the resolved pointer is adopted into the ledger only
on the writer path, so a human never leaves a gate-state file in their working tree for `ledger-guard`
to reject.

**In verified mode `gate sync` stays advisory even with `--pr`** — it prints the predicate and writes
nothing, because CI owns the ledger. The recovery that actually writes is the command CI itself runs,
on the default branch: `yad gate ci --branch <review-branch> --pr <n> --merged`.

**Serialization.** Both wired jobs push the ledger to the default branch, and on GitLab the scheduled
sweep's recent-MR window overlaps whatever the merge-push pipeline is handling — so they are pinned to
one at a time (`concurrency: yad-gate-mergesync` on GitHub, `resource_group: yad-gate-mergesync` on
GitLab). Without it both runs produce the same advance, one pushes, and the other rebases onto it and
lands a duplicate `chore(gate): advance …` commit under a different SHA — unreviewed churn, since
those commits carry `[skip ci]` and go straight to the default branch. An already-wired GitLab Product
picks the `resource_group` up on the next `yad update` / `yad check --fix`.

**`yad gate open` does not create or push the review branch.** It opens a PR/MR *against*
`review/<epic>/<artifact>`, so that branch must already be **on origin** — a local-only branch is no
use, because `gh pr create --head` does not push either. `yad open-pr`, run from the branch, pushes it
and then delegates here. Opening with the branch absent is refused up front, before any ledger write,
rather than failing inside `gh`/`glab`; an origin that cannot be reached at all only warns.

### Manual end-to-end verification (GitHub)

1. On a scratch Product: `yad setup` (platform github; a second account with write access to review) → `yad check --fix`
   installs `.github/workflows/yad-gate-sync.yml`; commit + push it.
2. Author an epic → `yad gate open EP-x epic.md` → the review PR opens. CI writes nothing yet — review
   state lives on the platform.
3. Second account **approves** / **requests changes** → no CI run touches the branch; the PR's native
   approvals + threads are the source of truth (local `yad gate sync` is advisory and shows the
   predicate without writing).
4. Resolve the thread, approve again, a human **merges** → the mergesync run advances `state.json`
   (`epic-review: done`, `currentStep: architecture`) + flips `epic.md` to `approved` **on the
   default branch**.
5. `git checkout <default> && git pull` locally — `yad gate status EP-x` matches the platform history.

GitLab variant: same flow on an MR; the advance lands on the merge push (or the next schedule tick if
a squash merge dropped the branch name).
