# pr-title gate.
# The PR/MR TITLE must follow the convention for its repo kind:
#   --profile code (default) — a Conventional-Commits subject "<type>: <description>", no trailing
#     period (config.yaml build.pr_title_style: same_as_commit_subject; one task = one PR, the title is
#     the squash-merge subject). Keep <type> in sync with cli/manifest.mjs COMMIT_TYPES.
#   --profile product (old name: hub) — a Shape artifact-review title "review: <artifact> (EP-<slug>)", the shape
#     `yad gate open` creates (cli/gate.mjs) — BUT only for review/EP-* head branches. Every other
#     Product PR is a tooling/code change to the Product itself and follows the code convention; pass the
#     head ref via --head so the gate can tell the two apart (a tooling PR has no EP artifact to
#     review). With no --head, the Product profile stays strict (requires the review shape).
#     Branch name is not enough on its own: a non-review head that actually changes Shape
#     artifacts (epics/**) would otherwise slip past the review workflow with a plain code title.
#     Pass the PR's changed paths via --changed <file> (one path per line); when they touch epics/**
#     on a non-review head the gate FAILS — artifact changes must go through a review/EP-* PR.
#     Build the list with `git -c core.quotePath=false diff --no-renames --name-only`: without
#     --no-renames a rename lists only its new path, and the removed artifact is never seen.
# The title is passed as the (single) positional arg; CI injects it from the event payload
# (GitHub: github.event.pull_request.title; GitLab: $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TITLE).

# This script and the workflow that passes the flag are both in PRODUCT_WIRING (cli/manifest.mjs) and
# normally land together on one `yad update` — but not always: a copy the team edited is kept. So the
# order is add-before-remove: the new spelling was accepted first, the workflow templates switched to
# emit it in E123 (`yad-product-checks.yml`), and the old one is dropped after that. `hub` stays
# accepted meanwhile, for a workflow of the team's own or one they edited. The other direction — an
# edited copy of THIS script from before 4.0, which rejects `product`, beside the new workflow — fails
# every Product PR; `yad update` and `yad doctor` (`profile:`) say so.
#
# Normalised to `product` immediately, so nothing below has to know there are two spellings. That is
# load-bearing in pr-title.sh and pr-template.sh: leave `$PROFILE` as `hub` and the `= product`
# branch is skipped, taking the whole review-branch arm with it — including the guard that stops a
# plain code title carrying an artifact change past its review.

# locale drops a line that is not valid UTF-8 from its output — the pipe would then read as "no artifact".
