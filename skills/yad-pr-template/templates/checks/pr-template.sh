# pr-template gate.
# The PR/MR BODY must actually USE the committed template — i.e. carry its required sections so the
# review (and risk-route.sh) has the inputs it needs. This catches an empty / free-form description
# that bypassed the template.
#   --profile code (default) — the code-repo task template (yad-pr-template templates/<platform>/):
#     requires `## Summary`, `## Impact & Risk`, `## Checklist`, and a filled `Risk level:` (low|medium|high).
#   --profile product (old name: hub) — the Shape artifact-review template (templates/product/<platform>/):
#     requires `## Artifact under review`, `## Impact & Risk (front-half)` (or `(Shape)`), `## Checklist`, and a `Risk tags:` line.
#     BUT only for review/EP-* head branches. Every other Product PR is a tooling/code change to the Product
#     itself and uses the code task template instead; pass the head ref via --head so the gate knows
#     which template to require. With no --head, the Product profile stays strict (artifact-review template).
#     Branch name is not enough on its own: a non-review head that actually changes Shape
#     artifacts (epics/**) would otherwise slip past the review workflow with only the code template.
#     Pass the PR's changed paths via --changed <file> (one path per line); when they touch epics/**
#     on a non-review head the gate FAILS — artifact changes must go through a review/EP-* PR.
#     Build the list with `git -c core.quotePath=false diff --no-renames --name-only`: without
#     --no-renames a rename lists only its new path, and the removed artifact is never seen.
# The body is passed as a FILE path (single positional arg); CI writes the event body to a temp file
# (GitHub: github.event.pull_request.body; GitLab: $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_DESCRIPTION).
