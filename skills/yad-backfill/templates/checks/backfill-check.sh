# the whole repo: touching feature A is never blocked by an unverified feature B. Features that are
# forward-spec'd (their own specs/<story>/) or not yet being backfilled are not this gate's concern.
# The spec and its approval are read from the BASE, and a link where a backfilled feature lives is
