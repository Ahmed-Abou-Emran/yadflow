# SDLC — Change/Defect Intake + Triage (Phase 6, the entry of a feature thread)

**Goal:** Turn a post-lock change request, defect, or hotfix into a **new epic threaded to its parent**,
so the feature's locked artifacts are never mutated — only *superseded*. The change-epic **inherits**
the Shape artifacts it does not change (by reference) and **re-authors** only the ones it does, so the
thread head always describes current behaviour and the SDLC stays a trusted source of truth for the next
change. This skill does the **intake + triage + seeding** and then hands off to the normal authoring
skills + `yad-review-gate`. It is a **Shape step**: human-confirmed, **never auto-advances**.

This is the answer to "the Shape/spec docs go stale after the contract locks": a behavioural change can
no longer ship through Build against an old story — `epic-open` seals a fully-shipped epic, so
new behaviour must enter here, and its re-authored stories/test-cases describe the change.

## Conventions

- `{project-root}` resolves from the Product.
- Artifacts live under `{project-root}/epics/EP-<slug>/` — the change-epic gets its OWN `EP-<slug>`
  (assigned here, never renamed) and its own `stories/EP-<slug>-S0N`, so every existing gate, the verified ledger,
  `yad next`, and the Build traceability keep working unchanged.
- The thread is **derived** from `parent:` frontmatter (no registry); `thread:` is a cache that must
  equal the computed root (`yad doctor` flags a mismatch). Thread id = the genesis epic's id.
- Lineage frontmatter, the inherited-step shape, the pointer-lock, `change.json`, and
  `reconcile-debt.json` are all defined in `../yad-epic/references/state-schema.md` (Phase 6 section).
- Genesis epics authored before Phase 6 must be **migrated once** (`kind: feature` + `type: feature`, `thread: <self>` in
  their `epic.md`) before a change threads off them — see `references/triage.md`.
- Speak in the `communication_language` set in `{project-root}/.sdlc/config.yaml`; write documents in `document_output_language`.

## Inputs

- `parent` — **required.** The `EP-<slug>` this change evolves (the thread predecessor; usually the
  feature's current tip).
- `title` — **required.** One line describing the change. It is written twice, with the same words:
  as `title:` in `epic.md` (Step 4) and as `title` in `change.json` (Step 6).
- `kind` (also accepted as `type`) — the work-item **type**: `change` | `defect` | `hotfix`
  (default `change`). Both input names mean the same thing, the same way both frontmatter keys do.
  `feature` and
  `chore` are the genesis types and are reserved for a work item with no parent (use `yad-epic`,
  not this skill). Two names carry this value — see Step 4.
- `origin` — defect/hotfix only: `production` | `staging` | `qa` | `review`.
- `severity` — defect/hotfix only: `sev1`..`sev4`.
- `escape_stage` — defect/hotfix only: the SDLC gate that *should* have caught it (`stories`,
  `test-cases`, `architecture`, …). Feeds the `yad-defects` quality report.
- `root_cause` — defect/hotfix only: a short tag (e.g. `missing-negative-test`).
- `description` — free text: what is wrong / what must change.
- `affected` — the artifacts the requester believes change (the triage confirms/adjusts this).

## On Activation

### Step 1 — Resolve the parent + thread (validate; STOP on a broken lineage)
Confirm `parent` exists (`epics/<parent>/epic.md` + `.sdlc/state.json`). Read its lineage and resolve
the thread root (`yad thread <parent>` / `resolveThread`). **STOP** if the parent is missing, or its
lineage is broken (a cycle, or a `thread` cache ≠ the computed root) — fix the parent first. If the
parent is a **genesis epic not yet migrated** (no type at all), migrate it now: add `kind: feature`, `type: feature` and
`thread: <its own id>` to its `epic.md` (a one-line, non-gated frontmatter add).

**Missing parent (brownfield) — never silent.** If the requested `parent` does **not exist at all**
because the feature was built before it had an epic, do NOT dead-end: point the user at **`yad-stub`** to
mint a stub genesis epic (a minimal `feature`-type thread anchor) for that feature first, then re-run
this skill with that stub as the `parent`. A change MUST still thread to a real parent — `yad-stub` just
creates the smallest real one so the defect can be captured now (the `yad-reconcile` → anchor → change
discipline).

The new epic's `thread` = the parent's thread (the genesis id). Its `parent` = the given `parent` (the
immediate predecessor — usually the current tip; if the parent is not the tip, see "concurrent changes"
in `references/triage.md`).

### Step 2 — Gather the change + triage the DEPTH (auto-propose, human-confirm)
With the requester, classify the change into one **depth** (the `yad-backfill` discipline: auto-propose,
human-confirm). The depth decides which Shape steps are **re-authored** vs **inherited**:

| depth | re-authors (active) | inherits (pre-done, by reference) | first step |
|-------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------|
| **defect-fix** — the spec was right, code/coverage was wrong | `stories` (a regression story), `test-cases` (the missing case) | epic, architecture, contract, ui-design | `stories` |
| **behavioral-no-surface** — behaviour changes, contract surface unchanged | epic (delta), `stories`, `test-cases` (+ ui-design if visible) | architecture, **contract (no re-lock)** | `stories` (or `ui-design`) |
| **contract-surface** — the shared cross-repo surface changes | **architecture + contract (RE-LOCK)**, `stories`, `test-cases` (+ epic/ui as needed) | whatever is genuinely untouched | `architecture` |
| **new-capability** — not a change to this feature, a new one | full chain (`epic`…`test-cases`) | lineage/context only | `epic` |

Print the chosen depth and the **re-author vs inherit** split; **get explicit confirmation** before
seeding. A `new-capability` is usually a *new genesis epic* (`yad-epic`) — only thread it when it truly
extends this feature's evolution.

### Step 3 — Derive the change-epic id + open the authoring branch
Derive a distinct `EP-<slug>` from the title (2–4 lowercase words; check `epics/` for collisions, append
a word if needed). Create `{project-root}/epics/EP-<slug>/`. Open the `change/EP-<slug>` authoring branch
per the shared "Authoring branches" procedure (git/greenfield-safe).

### Step 4 — Write `epic.md` (the change brief + lineage frontmatter)
Write a thin brief carrying the lineage frontmatter.

**Write the work-item type under BOTH names, with the same value.** `kind:` is the original name and
is still the one every reader uses; `type:` is the name from shape 5 on. Writing `type:` alone is the
one mistake here that breaks something: `lineage-check.sh` runs inside the code repo and reads
`kind:`. Finding none it defaults to `feature`, decides the epic is a parent-free genesis, and stops
requiring the `parent:` a change, defect or hotfix must have. `yad doctor` FAILS on that.

**Carry the parent's `theme:` down.** A theme is the free grouping tag that puts several epics under
one heading (there is no rung above the Epic; grouping is a label). Read the parent's `epic.md`: if it
has a `theme:`, copy the spelling **exactly** onto this one, so the change groups with the work it
changes. If the parent has none, leave `theme:` empty. Never invent a new spelling of an existing
theme — `yad doctor` reports that, because two spellings group as two themes. Write the tag bare, with
no `#`: `yad next` and `yad thread` print it as `#checkout-revamp`, but that `#` is decoration on the
screen and is kept as part of the value if it lands in the file.

**Write `title:` in `epic.md` too**, with the same words as the `title` input. It is the name a list of
work items shows for this change (E111). Write it on ONE line, as plain words. If it begins with `[` and ends with `]` (such as `[Mobile] Checkout [v2]`), wrap the whole title in double quotes, writing an inner `"` as `\"` — otherwise it is read as a list, which is not a title. Never end it with a `#` comment (the comment becomes part of the title), and never use a YAML block (`>` or `|`): only one line is read. "The same words" means the title as it READS: quotes you add around it in `epic.md` are not part of it, so do not copy them into `change.json`. The full rules are the `title` row of the `epic.md` frontmatter table in `../yad-epic/references/state-schema.md`. Set it now — the
review gate is bound to a hash of the file, so a title changed after approval drops the approval.

## Change
<!-- what is wrong / what must change, and why now -->

## Resolved current truth (input)
<!-- run `yad thread <parent>`: which epic currently owns each artifact this change builds on.
     Run `yad doctor` FIRST and resolve anything it reports about the parent's ledger. That map is
     built from each epic's `state.json`, and a ledger the engine cannot parse falls back to "this
     epic owns everything" — the safe answer for a read-only display, and the wrong one to copy into
     an `inheritedFrom`, which is a provenance record. An artifact shown as `(none)` has no owner:
     the parent's route never produced it, so there is nothing to inherit and nothing to point at. -->

## Re-authored vs inherited
<!-- the Step 2 split, for the reviewers -->
```

For a **contract-surface** depth, do NOT inherit `architecture` — it will be re-authored (and re-locked)
by `yad-architecture` downstream.

### Step 5 — Seed the ledger with the engine (inherited steps carried; only the changed steps run)
Run it from the Product, after Step 4 has written `epic.md`:

```bash
yad epic new EP-<slug> --type <change|defect|hotfix> --parent <EP-parent> --inherits <bases>
```

`<bases>` is the Step 2 inherit list, comma-separated — for a defect-fix off a `classic` parent,
`epic,architecture,contract,ui-design`. It must be the same list as `inherits:` in `epic.md`: the command
reads that header, takes its answer when a flag is left off, and refuses a flag that contradicts it. Leave
`--profile` off. The child takes the **parent's** route — a 4-step `chore` parent gives a 4-step child —
and the command refuses a route that differs.

The engine writes everything this step used to spell out by hand (E42):

- `.sdlc/state.json` — the parent's chain and route. Every inherited step **and its review gate** is
  `satisfied`, with `inherited: true`, `inheritedFrom` (the epic along the parent's line that owns the
  artifact — not always the parent), `boundHash` (that artifact's current hash) and a `record`. The first
  re-authored step is `in_progress` and is the `currentStep`; the rest are `todo`.
- `.sdlc/approvals.json` — one **provenance** record per inherited gate
  (`{ artifact, step, status: "inherited", from, boundHash, date }`) — never a forged approval.
- `.sdlc/comments.json` = `[]` and `reviews/`.
- `.sdlc/contract-lock.json` — the **pointer-lock**, only when `architecture` and `contract` are inherited:
  the owner's hash copied verbatim, with `inheritedFrom` and `ref`. There is no `contract.md` in the
  change-epic, so the surface cannot drift, and `contract-check` passes unchanged because the hash is
  identical. (Field shapes: `references/triage.md`.)

**A refusal means the triage is wrong, and nothing is written.** Fix the inherit list and run it again:

| The command says | Why | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `<owner> skipped <step>` | a skip is a decision, not an artifact — carrying it would claim a review nobody did | leave that base out of `inherits`, then `yad skip` it on this epic if it does not apply here either |
| `<owner> deferred <step>` | that work is still owed | leave the base out and author it on this epic, so the owed work follows the thread |
| `<owner> has not finished <step>` | nothing approved exists yet | finish it on the owner, or author it here |
| `holds no usable contract lock` / `surface no longer matches its lock` | you may skip authoring a contract, never having one | lock (or re-lock) the owner's surface first (`yad-architecture` Step 5) |
| `stories cannot be inherited` / `test-cases cannot be inherited` | every change writes its own; `stories-review` is what hands an epic to Build | leave them out |
| `architecture and contract are inherited together` | the architecture step writes `contract.md` | list both, or neither (a contract-surface change) |
| `route has no <base> step` | a short-lane parent never had it | leave it out |
| `architecture is owned by <A> but the contract by <B>` | one step writes both, so one epic must own both | in the epic between them, list both in `inherits:`, or neither |
| `ledger carries <step> from <epic>, but its epic.md does not list <base>` | that epic's two records disagree about where the artifact lives | fix that epic's `inherits:` first |
| `epic.md says …, --parent says …` · `--inherits says …` · `thread: …` · `has no parent:` / `has no thread:` · `write it as inherits: [a, b]` | the header is what `yad thread` reads, so it must say the same as the flags — in brackets for a list | fix `epic.md` (Step 4), or drop the flag |
| `already has a contract-lock.json` · `already has an approvals.json with records in it` | a file already there is somebody's record | remove it only if it is left over from a mistake |

Commit the seed on the `change/EP-<slug>` branch: the first `yad fold EP-<slug> <step>` there takes it
whole — the new ledger files and the new `change.json` / pointer `contract-lock.json` — beside that step's
artifact, while the epic has no `state.json` in HEAD (E44). It reaches the Product's default branch through this
change-epic's **first** review PR/MR — cut the `review/EP-<slug>/<artifact>` branch from `change/…` so
it carries the seed. In verified mode `ledger-guard` exempts a new epic's ledger (creation, not mutation,
#162), so no direct push to a protected default branch is needed; every later change to that ledger is
CI's. See `../yad-epic/references/state-schema.md`, "Authoring branches".

**Stub parent (brownfield, no locked surface yet).** When the `parent` is a **stub**
(`stub: backfill-pending` / `verified: false`, minted by `yad-stub`), it has no `architecture.md` /
`contract.md` / `ui-design.md` to inherit — the surface has not been documented yet. `yad epic new`
sees the anchor and carries those bases as `"inherited": true, "inheritedFrom": "<stub>", "boundHash": null`
(a `null` boundHash is treated as "nothing locked upstream → no drift" by the gate predicate, so the step
passes and never blocks), and it writes **NO** `contract-lock.json` (there is no surface to point at — the
child never touches `specs/*/contracts/**`, so `contract-check` passes trivially). Contract protection on
this thread begins only after `yad-backfill promote` documents and locks the feature. Record
`"parentStub": true` in `change.json` so it is auditable that the change threaded off an undocumented
stub. Prefer the `defect-fix` / `behavioral-no-surface` depth against a stub — a `contract-surface`
change against an undocumented feature should wait until the stub is promoted (backfilled + a real
contract locked).

**Short-lane parent (no architecture step ever existed).** When the parent records `profile: "chore"`
or `"spike"`, it has no `architecture.md`, no `contract.md`, no `ui-design.md` and no lock — not
because they are undocumented, as with a stub, but because **its route never had those steps**. The
engine already handles the ledger: it seeds the parent's short chain and route, writes no lock, and
refuses `architecture`, `contract` or `ui-design` in `inherits`, because inheriting a step the parent
never walked would stamp `inherited: true` on a review that never happened anywhere. What is left for
this skill:

- **Record `"parentShortLane": "<the parent's profile>"` in `change.json`**, the same way a stub parent
  records `"parentStub": true`, so it is auditable that this thread inherited from a route with no
  locked surface.
- **A `contract-surface` depth is not available here.** Its first runnable step is `architecture`,
  which this chain does not have. If the change really does move the shared cross-repo surface, it is
  not a thread off this parent — seed a **new epic on `classic`** and note the parent in its lineage.
  Prefer `defect-fix` or `behavioral-no-surface`, exactly as against a stub.

### Step 6 — Write `.sdlc/change.json` (intake + triage record)
Record the intake: `epicId`, `thread`, `parent`, `kind` **and `type`** (the same value under both
names, as in `epic.md`), `depth`, `intakeBy`, `intakeDate`, `title`,
`description`, `affectedArtifacts`, `reauthors`, `inherits`, and for a defect/hotfix the `defect` block
(`origin`, `severity`, `escape_stage`, `root_cause`). This is what `yad-defects` reads to attribute the
defect to the gate that should have caught it. Add `"parentStub": true` when the parent is an
un-promoted stub (Step 5) — omit it (or `false`) otherwise.

### Step 7 — Hotfix only: record the ship-first exception + open reconcile debt
If the type is `hotfix`, Build MAY run before these Shape gates approve (severity demands it). Record
`hotfix: { "shipFirst": true }` in `change.json` and **append** to `.sdlc/reconcile-debt.json`:
`{ "thread": "<…>", "epicId": "<…>", "openedDate": "<today>", "reason": "<why>", "requires": ["artifacts-updated","regression-test"], "status": "open", "paidDate": null, "paidBy": null, "evidence": { "artifacts": [], "regressionTest": "" } }`.
Tell the user the debt **freezes the next normal change** on this thread (`reconcile-debt` gate) until it
is paid (Shape artifacts updated **and** a regression test added, then `status: "paid"`).

### Step 8 — Stop; hand off (NO auto-advance)
Report: the new `EP-<slug>`, its thread + parent, the re-author-vs-inherit split, the seeded
`currentStep`, and the next skill — run `yad next EP-<slug>` and name what it names, followed by
`yad-review-gate`. Do NOT name a skill from memory: which skill runs a step is the project's setting
(`.sdlc/skills.json`, for every epic or for this epic's route), so a team that bound its own would be sent to one this epic will never use
again. Unbound, that command names `yad-architecture` for a contract-surface change and `yad-stories`
/ `yad-test-cases` otherwise, which is what this step used to say. Shape steps do not auto-advance. Suggest
`yad thread <thread>` to see the evolution and `yad-timeline` / `yad-defects` to render it.

## Hard rules

- **Never mutate a locked artifact.** A change is a new threaded epic, not an edit to a shipped one.
  The one exception is BEFORE Build starts — no Build lane has work in it and nothing has shipped: then
  reopen the approved step with `yad gate reopen <epic> <step> --reason "<why>"` (#322) instead of
  threading a change epic; every gate from that step is approved again.
- **A change MUST thread to a real parent.** Validate the parent + thread first; STOP on a broken lineage.
- **Inherit by reference, never copy.** `yad epic new --parent` carries inherited steps as `satisfied` with
  `inherited: true` + a `boundHash`; the pointer-lock carries the owner's hash verbatim. The gate never
  re-reviews them, and only work written AND approved upstream can be carried.
- **Contract-surface ⇒ re-author architecture.** Omitting `architecture` from `inherits` is the ONLY way
  to change the surface; it re-locks (new hash) and routes through the architecture review again (its `contract` tag raises the full approver count, which stays advisory — E72 reports it capped at the active people less one) —
  the same mechanism as the Build `Contract-Change` route, unified.
- **A hotfix opens debt, never waives it.** Ship-first is allowed once; the thread freezes for new work
  until the debt is paid.
- **Never auto-advances.** This skill seeds + records; humans author and approve via the normal gates.
