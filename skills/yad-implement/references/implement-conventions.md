# Implement conventions — branch, commit, file boundary, contract change

Step B (`yad-implement`) turns ONE atomic task into ONE branch and ONE commit in the code repo. These
conventions are what the later steps (check gates §C, PR template §D, review §E) rely on to trace a
diff back to its task, story, and contract.

## Branch naming

```
feat/<story-id>-<task-id>-<short-slug>
```

- `<story-id>` — the permanent story ID, e.g. `EP-checkout-S01`.
- `<task-id>` — the atomic task ID from `tasks.md`, e.g. `T01`.
- `<short-slug>` — 2–4 hyphenated words naming the change, e.g. `create-order`.

Example: `feat/EP-checkout-S01-T01-create-order`. Branched off the code repo's default
branch. One task = one branch; never reuse a branch for a different task, never fork a second branch
for the same task.

## Commit message

```
<type>: <subject ending with what changed>

<body — what and why, 1–3 lines>

[Decisions:
- Q: <question> → A: <answer>]

Task: <story-id>-<task-id>
[Contract-Change: yes]
[Co-Authored-By: <AI name> <email>]
```

- **`Decisions:`** (#357) holds the answers to the human-only questions the skill asked before any
  code (`yad-implement` Step 3). Leave it out when nothing was asked. It is its own paragraph, above
  the trailers, so git never reads it as a trailer.
- The **`<type>` is lowercase** (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`, `build`, `ci`,
  `chore`, `revert`) and the **`<subject>` starts lowercase**, is **imperative**, and has **no trailing
  period** — Conventional Commits (see `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `config.yaml` `build.commit_subject_style`).
  Proper nouns/acronyms keep their case (`fix: refresh OAuth token`). e.g. `feat: add POST /orders
  create path`, not `feat: Add POST /orders create path.`
- The **`Task:` trailer is required** (`Task: EP-checkout-S01-T01`) — the anchor the spec-link
  check (§C) and the PR (§D) read to connect the diff to its spec and story. It need not be the *last*
  line: the spec-link gate finds it with git's native trailer parser
  (`%(trailers:key=Task)`), which is order-independent. All trailers must sit in **one contiguous block**
  in the last paragraph (no blank lines between them) so git parses them as trailers.
- **Trailer order:** `Task:` → `Contract-Change:` (if any) → `Co-Authored-By:` (if any), last.
- `Contract-Change: yes` appears **only** when the diff alters the locked contract surface (see below).
  Omit it for normal implementation.

## Commit ownership & AI co-authors

The **human git author owns the commit** (`config.yaml` `build.commit_owner: git_author`). When an AI
tool assisted, record it **per commit** as a `Co-Authored-By` trailer — the AI is a co-author, **never**
the author. The owner picks the tool from `config.yaml` `build.ai_coauthor.allowed`:

```
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
Co-Authored-By: GitHub Copilot <copilot@users.noreply.github.com>
Co-Authored-By: Cursor <noreply@cursor.com>
Co-Authored-By: CodeRabbit <noreply@coderabbit.ai>
```

- Choose the entry whose `id` matches the tool that actually helped author the diff; add more than one
  line if several did. CodeRabbit is a co-author only when it **contributed code**, not when it merely
  reviewed (that is `ai_review` in `yad-engineer-review`).
- For a fully human-authored commit, pick `id: none` — i.e. **omit** the trailer. `ai_coauthor.required`
  is `false`, so a missing trailer is valid and no gate fails on it.
- `yad-implement` installs the `.gitmessage` template (`templates/.gitmessage`) and sets
  `git config commit.template .gitmessage` in the repo, so these lines are pre-scaffolded (commented) for
  the owner to uncomment.

## File-boundary rule (hard stop)

Each task in `tasks.md` (a light spec: its block between `<!-- yad:tasks -->` and `<!-- /yad:tasks -->`
in `spec.md`, #348) declares a `Files:` list (≤3 where possible). The implementation diff must stay
**inside that list**. If the task genuinely needs a file not listed:

1. **Stop.** Do not widen the diff silently.
2. Report the extra file(s) needed.
3. Treat it as a **spec bug**: the task's declared files were wrong. Correct the task (re-run
   `yad-spec` / re-scope) so the boundary is right, then implement.

A diff that quietly spreads beyond the declared files is the single easiest way to smuggle unreviewed
scope past the gates — hence the hard stop.

## Contract-change rule

The **locked contract surface** is the cross-repo agreement in `epics/<epic>/contract.md` (the
`CONTRACT-SURFACE` block, hash-locked at `.sdlc/contract-lock.json`). Distinguish:

- **Consuming the contract** (normal) — implementing an endpoint/event/entity to the shape the contract
  already agreed (e.g. building `POST /orders` to its agreed request/response). **Not** a contract
  change; no trailer.
- **Changing the contract** (exceptional) — altering the agreed shape itself (new field crossing repos,
  changed status enum, new shared endpoint). This is **not** an implementation decision. Stop, go back
  to the **architecture gate**, amend and re-lock `contract.md` (which sends that review round again; its contract `risk_tags`
  raise the full approver count, which is advisory — E72 reports it capped at the active people less one), and only then implement — recording `Contract-Change: yes` so the §C
  contract-check finds the matching, already-updated contract.

This keeps the contract singular and owned upstream: a code repo can never widen the shared surface
from inside an implementation branch.

## Why one task at a time

Small diffs scoped to declared files are reviewable, revertable, and traceable. The heavy spec ceremony
(specify→tasks) ran once for the whole story in Step A; Step B is the **light loop** — repeat per task,
each its own branch and PR, each passing the gates independently.
