description: 'The reusable team review + approve gate for the SDLC. Shares an authored artifact for review, records reviewer comments and approvals as files, enforces the approver count (1 distinct approver; contract/auth/payments raise the full count, advisory), and advances the epic state ONLY when approval is recorded.

# SDLC — Team Review Gate (build plan §3 piece 2, §4, §5)

**Goal:** One reusable step type that turns any authored artifact into a gated, human-approved
review. Every `review+approve` step in the workflow (the optional analysis, epic, architecture+contract,
UI, stories, test-cases) uses this exact gate. **No step advances until its review is approved** and
recorded as a file. Every review uses the same **count** rule: distinct approvers, base 1. A step's
`risk_tags` raise the full count. The engine caps that count at the number of active people less one
and shows it (E72), but only the base holds the gate; the risk step is advisory.

This gate is **swappable and file-driven**: it talks only through files. A Shape step advances only on a
human act — recording an approval and `advance`, or (with a verified ledger) **merging the approved,
fully-resolved review PR/MR**. It works the same whether a human or the `yad gate` CLI triggers it — the
trigger is a parameter, not a hardcoded human.

## Conventions
- `{project-root}` resolves from the project working directory.
- Operate on one epic: `{project-root}/epics/EP-<slug>/`. The Product level is the exception:
  `EP-foundation` lives at `{project-root}/foundation/` (its `.sdlc/` and `reviews/` are there).
- State files: `.sdlc/state.json`, `.sdlc/approvals.json`, `.sdlc/comments.json`, and (when the verified ledger is
  used) `.sdlc/product-prs.json` (written together with its older name `hub-prs.json`). Review records: `reviews/`.
- The artifact base name drops the extension (`epic.md` → `epic`; story `stories/...S01.md` → `stories-S01`).

## Inputs
- `epic`: the `EP-<slug>` to operate on.
- `artifact`: the file under the epic being reviewed (e.g. `epic.md`).
- `action`: one of `open` | `comment` | `approve` | `sync` | `advance` (default: `open`). With no platform,
  `comment` / `approve` / `advance` are the `yad gate comment|approve|advance` commands (E112).
- For `comment` / `approve`: the reviewer's platform login (or the name they give, when there is no
  platform). No role and no domain. Ask if not provided.
- `sync` needs no reviewer input — it reads the platform PR/MR review state (via `yad-product-bridge`).

## On Activation

### Step 1 — Load state
Read `.sdlc/state.json`. Find the `review+approve` step whose `artifact` matches the input (or the
step named `currentStep` if it is a review step). Read `.sdlc/approvals.json`. Read `epic.md` for the
epic's `repos` (the **touched domains**). Determine the **count** for this step. It counts people, not
roles — there are no roles, and yadflow keeps no list of people:
- **Base (enforced):** at least **1 distinct approver**, who should not be the author. The engine does
  not check that: GitHub stops you approving your own PR, GitLab does only when the project's approval
  settings say so, and on a local ledger nothing does — so do not record the author's own approval.
- **Full count, capped and reported (E72):** `needed = base 1 + risk step`. The risk step comes from the
  step's `risk_tags`: `contract` +2, `auth`/`payments` +1 (the "high" tier). Take the highest tag, never
  the sum. The engine then **caps** that ask at `active − 1`, with a floor of 1. `active` is the live
  count of people who committed or approved lately (E71). Example: a contract gate asks 3; with 2 active
  people the capped ask is 1, with 3 it is 2, with 4 or more all 3. The `− 1` is one seat left for the
  author — a seat, not a check: the platform decides whether the author may approve.
- **The risk step is ADVISORY, capped or not.** Report the shortfall against the capped ask
  (`short`); never block on it. Why: the count of people errs high in the normal case. A commit is
  counted by its git name, an approval by its platform login, and yadflow never joins the two without
  exact evidence — so a two-person team can read as four. At four the cap lowers nothing, and an enforced
  contract gate would ask three approvals of a team with one person who is not the author. Enforcing the
  capped count is parked (roadmap E108) until the count is accurate.
- **Relay a warning line.** Under a team gate that has not passed, `yad gate status` and `yad gate sync`
  print `! may not be met: …` (today's one required approval may have nobody but the author to give
  it) or `! if the risk step were enforced: …` (a what-if about the extra approvals) when the count of
  people suggests the gate may not pass (E73). Never block on it and never write it into the ledger. Tell the
  reviewers while the review is open, because a merged review PR can no longer take approvals.
  In solo mode, `yad gate status` prints `! solo mode is on, but …` instead when the count shows more than
  one person may work on the Product (E74). Relay it as a suggestion to run `yad mode team`; never switch
  the mode yourself, and never read it as a fault.
- **When the people cannot be counted** (`active: null` — for example Product CI, which checks out only
  the Product, so the connected repos are not on disk): **no cap is computed or shown**, and the base holds as
  always. `yad gate status` and `yad gate sync` print the arithmetic — read it from there rather than
  recomputing it.
- **Touched domains** only name and label the review; they add no approvals. For a step with a risk
  tag (the **architecture+contract** review) they are the epic's `repos`. For the **stories** review they
  are the **union of every story's `repos`** under `stories/`. `stories-review` is an ordinary count gate.

This is **one gate** for every step — never a forked or copied gate. The tags change the full count
and nothing else.

### Step 2 — Dispatch on `action`

> **Check the mode first — in verified mode you write nothing to the ledger.** Read `.sdlc/product.json` (`.sdlc/hub.json` on an older Product that has only that name):
> **verified mode** is `platform` set AND `ledger: "verified"` — or, on a project that has not run `yad migrate` yet, `bridge_enabled` (or legacy `bridge`) `true`. `ledger` wins whenever it is present. Under the verified ledger
> the ledger is CI-owned — `ledger-guard` rejects any non-bot commit touching
> `epics/*/.sdlc/{state,approvals,comments,product-prs,hub-prs}.json` or `epics/*/reviews/*.md` (and the
> same files under `foundation/`), local `yad gate
> sync` is advisory, and `yad gate ci --merged` writes the whole transition when the review PR merges.
> So every "set / append / write" instruction below is the **local, or a platform with no
> gate-sync CI** path. Recording approvals, comments and the advance yourself is the **no-platform**
> path only (`yad gate approve` / `comment` / `advance`, E112): with a platform those commands refuse, the
> PR/MR carries the review, and `yad gate sync` writes it into a local ledger. In verified mode do the human-facing half — present the artifact, say how many
> approvers the step needs, help the owner address comments — and let the platform PR/MR carry the review
> state; the approvals, comments, review records and the advance all land through CI at merge.

**`open`** — Present the artifact for review. Summarise what changed, say how many approvers the step
needs (base, and the full count from its risk tags), and tell reviewers how to comment/approve. Then
make the transition with the engine:

```bash
yad gate open <epic> <artifact>
```

**Do not hand-write this one.** It does three things, and the second is the one a transcription keeps
forgetting:

1. marks the review step `in_review`;
2. **closes the paired authoring step as `done`** — a gate cannot open on an unauthored artifact, and
   an author step left `in_progress` behind a passed gate blocks every step after it
   (`YAD-STATE-005`, issue #131) until someone runs `yad gate repair`;
3. moves `currentStep` to the gate — **except** when the epic is already `ready-for-build`, where it
   leaves it alone, so opening the parallel `test-cases` gate never pulls the epic back from Build.

With **no platform** configured it writes the ledger and simply opens no PR, so this works offline.
With a platform, the `review/<epic>/<artifact>` branch must already be **on origin** — cut it from the
authoring branch and push it, or run `yad open-pr` from it, which pushes first and then delegates here.
In **verified mode** the command deliberately writes nothing: CI owns the ledger and performs the whole
transition at merge.

Do not advance.

If `.sdlc/product.json` (`.sdlc/hub.json` on an older Product) has a non-null `platform` and `gh`/`glab` is authenticated, **`yad gate open` also
opens the review PR/MR on the Product** (the recipe is `yad-product-bridge action: open`; do not open a
second one), and you report the URL. This holds for a verified ledger and for a local one. The PR
requests **no reviewers**; the command prints
`no reviewers were requested — ask them on the PR itself`, so tell the author to ask people on the PR.
The PR is recorded in `epics/<epic>/.sdlc/product-prs.json` and `hub-prs.json`, same bytes (`{step, artifact, platform, number, url, branch, lastSyncedAt}`):
**by CI at merge** in verified mode (`ledger: "verified"`, or, before `yad migrate`, `bridge_enabled: true` /
legacy `bridge: true` — `.sdlc/product.json` (else `.sdlc/hub.json`) is the only source the CLI reads, see `isVerifiedLedger` in
`cli/manifest.mjs`), and by `yad gate open` itself on a local ledger. Never write it by hand (see `sync`
below). With no platform, or when the PR cannot be opened on a local ledger, the step is still
`in_review` locally — no error. (In verified mode a failed open writes nothing; open the PR by hand and
CI records the gate at merge.) Opening the PR records no approvals and never advances.

**`comment`** — Capture reviewer feedback. Append/create a review file
`reviews/<artifact-base>--<YYYY-MM-DD>--comments.md` with a heading per reviewer:

```markdown
# Review comments — <artifact> — <YYYY-MM-DD>

## <reviewer>
- <comment>
- <comment>
```

Then record the round with the engine — **never append to `.sdlc/comments.json` by hand**:
```bash
yad gate comment <epic> <artifact> --by <name> --count <comments this round>          # the round in progress
yad gate comment <epic> <artifact> --by <name> --count <n> --new-round                # after the owner addressed the last round
```
`--new-round` opens the next round only when the artifact has changed since the latest round (the owner
addressed it by editing); otherwise it joins the latest round, so a retry or a second reviewer never opens
a round that did not happen. It writes one participation record per `(step, commenter, round)` — the markdown stays the human-readable
record, this makes commenter names queryable, the counterpart to `approvals.json`. It records no `role` or
`domain` (older records may carry them; nothing reads them). This is the **no-platform** path (E112): with
a platform the comments are the PR/MR's threads, and the command refuses and names `yad gate sync`.
With no platform a comment never holds the gate — there are no threads to resolve.

Then help the **owner address the comments** using the agent lens listed for this step
(analysis → `analyst`; epic → `pm`; architecture → `architect`; ui-design → `ux-designer`;
stories → `pm`, with `architect` for technical detail; test-cases → `test architect`). Update the authored artifact in place.
Repeat comment→address rounds until reviewers are satisfied. **Commenting never advances the gate.**

**`approve`** — Record an approval with the engine — **never append to `.sdlc/approvals.json` by hand**:
```bash
yad gate approve <epic> <artifact> --by <name> [--engagement verified|none]
```
One record per person (a second approval by the same name replaces the first). It records no `role` or
`domain`. The approver must not be the artifact's author: the command warns when `--by` is the epic's
`owner:` or the artifact's last git author, and records it anyway (it cannot tell who is typing), so do
not run it for the author. The record carries the artifact's fingerprint (`artifactHash`), so **an edit to
the artifact revokes it**, exactly as a platform approval is revoked — the reviewer approves again once they
have seen the new content. An older hand-written record with no fingerprint still counts until it is
replaced. This is the **no-platform** path (E112): with a platform the approvals are the PR/MR's, and the
command refuses and names `yad gate sync`; on a verified ledger CI writes them at merge.
`engagement` records whether the approval came through the [Review Companion](../yad-review-companion/SKILL.md)
(a real trailer/cards/chat session = `verified`) or as a bare click (`none`). It is soft by default
(both count; a bare approve draws a friendly nudge) and only gates when `review.requireEngagement` (Product settings)
is on — see `references/gating.md`. The signal is gameable by design ("visible, not impossible").
Then write/refresh `reviews/<artifact-base>--<YYYY-MM-DD>--approved.md` as a **named record** — the command
writes the ledger only, never this file, so rewrite it after every `yad gate approve`. It has three
sections, so every participant is attributable in one place:

```markdown
# Approval record — <artifact> — <YYYY-MM-DD>

Count: **<have> distinct approver(s)** — <the sum, e.g. `3 approvers = base 1 + contract risk 2`>; <the engine's suffix, e.g. `capped to 1: 2 active people, less one seat for the author — base enforced, risk step advisory`, or just `base enforced, risk step advisory` when no cap lowered the ask; nothing after the sum when the step has no risk tag>[, short <N> — recorded here, never blocking].

## Approved by
- <approver> — approved <date>[ (<source>)]

## Reviewed / commented by (participation, from comments.json)
- <commenter> — <n> comment(s) across <r> round(s)

## Still required to pass the gate
- <"1 approval(s)", or "none">

Gate status: **<PASSED | BLOCKED>** — <reason>.
```

The command prints the verdict (Step 3) itself. Recording an approval does NOT advance — advancement is a
separate, explicit act (`advance`), the way approving a PR never merges it.

**`sync`** — (the platform bridge input path) Pull the Product review PR/MR's review state into the ledger,
then re-evaluate the rule (Step 3). Read the PR for this step from `.sdlc/product-prs.json` (`hub-prs.json` when that is absent) and use
`yad-product-bridge`'s read recipes (`../yad-product-bridge/references/bridge.md`) to fetch reviews + comments
via the local user's `gh`/`glab`. For each:
- the platform `login` is the name written — `approver` / `commenter` is the login itself. There is no
  lookup and no role (see `../yad-product-bridge/references/login-roster.md`);
- an `APPROVED` review / MR approval → append an `approved` record to `approvals.json` tagged
  `"source": "bridge"`; a `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review or an unresolved thread → write to
  `reviews/<artifact-base>--<YYYY-MM-DD>--comments.md` + `comments.json` (never an approval). A resolved
  thread, and a companion comment marked `<!-- yad:noblock -->`, is not written.
**Idempotent:** upsert bridge approvals by `(step, approver)` — one record per person. An older record
that still carries `role`/`domain` and names a person by their old roster name is recognised as
`../yad-product-bridge/references/login-roster.md` → "Older records" describes, and replaced by one
login-named record that keeps its fingerprint. Every sync write (`yad gate sync`, `yad gate ci`) also
records the login on the older records the roster can place for certain, on every step (same reference → "Recording the login on older records").
A bridge approval records the platform's evidence — `approvedAt`, and on GitHub `commit`, `url` and
`reviewId` — for the record only; the gate decides on the login and the fingerprint. Supersede revoked ones
**while the step is open** (a step already `done` keeps its approvals — they are the record of why it
passed). Comment records are upserted by `(step, commenter, round)`: when the latest round already
has the same commenters and counts, it is rewritten in place, so re-running `sync` does not duplicate
it. **Manual approvals (no `source` tag) are never touched.** For the architecture+contract step, the
fingerprint a bridge approval is bound to is the contract surface, so a re-lock makes every approval of
the old surface stale: it stays on disk and no longer counts (re-lock invalidates platform approvals
too). Then, when the sync learned
something (an approval, a comment round, the step state or a nudge changed, or the review was never
synced), refresh the `approved.md` record and set the PR ledger's `lastSyncedAt`; an unchanged re-sync
writes neither (issue #362). Always **re-evaluate Step 3**. **Never hand-write either PR-ledger file.** It lives under two names until v5 — `product-prs.json` (read first) and `hub-prs.json` — and the engine writes both together. Writing one leaves the pair disagreeing, and then every yad command refuses (YAD-STATE-008) until `yad migrate --apply` settles it. Use `yad gate`, which keeps them in step.  Under the PR-driven CLI (`yad
gate sync`), `sync` advances the step when Step 3 passes on a **merged**, fully-resolved, approved PR
(the merge is the human act); otherwise it records state and holds the step `in_review`.

**`advance`** — Run the gate predicate (Step 3) and advance only if it passes. With no platform that is
`yad gate advance <epic> <artifact>`; with a platform it is the merge (`yad gate sync` / `yad gate ci`).

### Step 3 — Gate predicate (the only path that advances)
The step may advance **iff ALL hold**:
1. the advance dial is `human` (`automation: human_approve` — it always is for Shape steps) and the base
   is met: **≥1 distinct approver** (counted by `approver`, so two records from one person are one).
   If it is not, the missing line is `1 approval(s)`. **The risk step (Step 1) is NOT a condition
   here, capped or not** — it is advisory. A step short of the capped ask still advances when
   the base holds. Report the shortfall in the record; do not hold the step on it.
   This matches `gatePredicate`, which returns `rule: "count"`, the count as `gateRule`/`have`/`short`,
   `active`, and `cap` (null when `active` is null), and never puts the risk step in `missing`.
   `active: null` means no source could be read, never "nobody". With `review.requireEngagement` (Product settings)
   on, only `verified` approvals count.
2. The artifact has not changed since the latest approval round (no newer authored edit than the
   newest `approved` record). If it changed, approvals are stale → return to `comment`. For the
   **architecture+contract** review, also recompute the contract-surface hash (see
   `../yad-architecture/references/contract-format.md`): if it no longer matches
   `.sdlc/contract-lock.json`, the surface changed → approvals stale → return to `comment` and re-lock.

If the predicate **passes**, advance with the engine — **never edit `state.json` by hand**:

```bash
yad gate advance <epic> <artifact>     # a Product with no platform (E112)
```

With a platform you do not run it at all: `yad gate sync` (local ledger) or `yad gate ci` (verified) makes
the same transition when the review PR/MR merges, and `yad gate advance` refuses. Both run one function,
`advanceState` in `cli/epic-state.mjs`, so the rules below are a description of what it does, for
narrating the result — not steps to perform:

- the review step becomes `done` with a closing record (E18): `via: "approved"` from `yad gate advance`
  (nothing merged, so no `pr` or `commit`), `via: "merge"` from a merge. In solo mode it carries
  `waived: "solo"` (E10); in team mode, when the cap lowered the ask, `capped: { needed, to, active }` (E72);
- the paired authoring step is closed too if it was not already (`via: "review-passed"`, issue #131), and a
  `closed` record already on a step is never written over;
- `"debt": true` is removed from both steps — passing the review is what pays a debt back (E41);
- `stories-review` sets `currentStep: "ready-for-build"` and opens the parallel `test-cases` track;
  `test-cases-review` leaves `currentStep` at `ready-for-build`; `foundation-review` ends at
  `foundation-done` (the old `discovery-review` at `discovery-done`);
- any other review step moves `currentStep` to the next step that has not already passed (skipped,
  deferred, inherited and done steps are stepped over), or to `ready-for-build` when none is left. That
  step is set `in_progress` (authoring) or `in_review` **only if it is `todo`**: one already started keeps
  its status, and a `blocked` step **with** a `record` (waiting on someone outside the workflow) is left
  as it is. A gate that passed behind the chain (a step re-opened with a late `yad undefer`) moves
  nothing else.

If the predicate **fails**, report exactly which approvals are still missing and stop: `yad gate advance`
writes nothing, exits 1 and lists them, and `currentStep` does not move.
A step already `done` is never advanced again; a `deferred` step is put back with `yad undefer` first.

One other skill still writes a chain by hand, and it is not an oversight: `yad-backfill promote` rewrites
one, and needs its own verb. (`yad-discovery` used to be one; since E75 it runs `yad foundation new`.
`yad-change` used to seed a threaded chain by hand; since E42 it runs `yad epic new --parent`. This skill
used to be one too, transcribing `advanceState` for a Product with no platform; since E112 it runs
`yad gate advance`.)

Report the advance and what the next authored artifact is (or that the epic is now `ready-for-build`, with
`test-cases` running in parallel).

### PR-driven automation (the `yad gate` CLI)
When the Product has a platform and a **verified** ledger, **CI is the sole writer of the ledger**. (With a
platform and a local ledger, `yad gate open` and `yad gate sync` write it instead.) `yad gate open` opens the review
PR only — against the `review/<epic>/<artifact>` branch, which must already exist (create it and run
`yad open-pr` from it, which pushes it first). CI (`yad gate ci`) writes the `.sdlc/` + `reviews/`
records this skill describes. The skill's
job is the human half: presenting the artifact, helping the owner address comments, and narrating the
gate. Local `yad gate sync` is advisory in verified mode (reads the platform, prints status, writes
nothing); a human must never commit gate-state files (the `ledger-guard` check rejects it, and the
`hooks/ledger-guard.mjs` harness hook refuses an agent the edit up front, naming `yad gate open`
instead — see `yad-checks`). The single
exception is an epic's **seed** — no CI path can create a ledger, so a brand-new epic's `.sdlc/` rides
its **first** review PR/MR, cut from the authoring branch (creation, not mutation, #162).

Under that CLI the gate **advances on merge**: a review PR/MR whose base count is met, whose
comment threads are **all resolved**, and which has been **merged** auto-marks the step `done` and
unblocks the next step. (Until those three hold, the step stays `in_review`.)

**Re-reviewing a step that already advanced.** A step is advanced **once** — the chain is never pulled
backward. But a step that is `done` is still *synced*: when the artifact is edited (for architecture, a
re-locked contract surface) its prior approvals go stale, and the approvals arriving on the new review
PR/MR are recorded and bound to the new content. `yad gate status` then shows the truth — how many
approvals are live against what is in the file today, and how many were revoked — instead of a `done`
step whose approvals all belong to the version before the edit.

The flow is **merge-driven** (wired by `yad-product-bridge` `wire`): during review CI writes nothing — the
platform PR/MR is the source of truth (native approvals + threads), and CI never touches the review
branch (so an in-flight approval is never dismissed and required checks never strand). On the human
**merge** CI re-reads approvals, advances the step, and flips the artifact `status:` on the **default
branch**. After a merge, `git checkout <default> && git pull` to see it. The predicate and the human
merge are unchanged — CI never approves and never merges. Local mode (no platform) keeps the local
write path.

### Hard rules (build plan §1, §5)
- **The merge click is the human approval act.** A Shape step advances only when a human merges the
  approved, fully-resolved review PR — or, on a Product with no platform, when a person runs
  `yad gate advance` — there is no machine-driven advance. A review gate is never `advance: auto`
  (`yad dial` refuses it); refuse such a request.
- **Approvals are revoked when the reviewed artifact changes.** `sync` re-hashes the artifact (the locked
  contract surface for architecture; every other file without its frontmatter `status:` line, which the
  gate and Build rewrite after review) and drops any approval bound to a stale hash, so a reviewer must
  re-approve the new content. Unresolved comments / `CHANGES_REQUESTED` hold the gate `in_review`.
- The gate talks only through `.sdlc/` and `reviews/` files — never hidden state.
- **The platform is an input path only.** `open`/`sync` use the local user's own `gh`/`glab` (no stored
  tokens), and the **file ledger remains the source of truth** — the Step 3 predicate is unchanged
  whether approvals arrive manually or via `sync`. With no Product platform / no CLI, the gate runs local
  with no error: `yad gate approve`, `yad gate comment` and `yad gate advance` record the review in the
  engine (E112).
- **A passed gate is taken back only by `yad gate reopen`** (#322), and only before Build starts:
  `yad gate reopen <epic> <step> --reason "<why>"` walks the chain back to the step and revokes the
  later reviews' approvals, so each gate runs again. Never edit `state.json` or `approvals.json` by hand
  to do it.
