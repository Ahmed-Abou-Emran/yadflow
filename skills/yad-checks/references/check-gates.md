# Check gates — definitions, scripts, CI wiring, convention map

The gates are the production-safety core of Build (Phase 3 build plan §C). They are
deliberately small, separate, and CI-agnostic: plain bash in `checks/`, invoked by whatever CI the
repo uses. Each reads conventions established by earlier steps — it invents nothing.

For people, `docs/GATES.md` in the yadflow repo lists every gate's rules, exemptions and failure
messages, with what to change for each. When a gate's rule or message changes, update that page too.

## What each gate reads (the convention map)

| Gate | Reads | Source step |
|------|-------|-------------|
| spec-link | the `Task: <story>-<task>` commit trailer; `specs/<story>/link.md` | `yad-implement` (trailer), `yad-spec` (link.md) |
| contract-check | changed files under `specs/<story>/contracts/`; the `Contract-Change: yes` trailer; `link.md`'s pinned `contract-lock`; the product repo's `contract-lock.json` | `yad-architecture` (lock), `yad-spec` (slice + link), `yad-implement` (trailer) |
| build/test/lint | the repo's configured package manager running `lint` / `build` / `test` | the repo |
| lineage-check | the `Task:` trailer → `link.md` (`epic`, which must be the story ID's prefix, + `product-repo`, read from the base — §8); the owning epic's work-item type (`kind:`, then `type:`) and `parent` frontmatter in the Product | `yad-spec` (link.md), `yad-change` (lineage frontmatter) |
| epic-open | the `Task:` trailer → `link.md` (`epic`, the story ID's prefix; `product-repo`, from the base — §8) → the Product epic's `stories/*.md` `status:` (sealed = all `shipped`) | `yad-engineer-review` (story status), `yad-change` (the change-epic) |
| reconcile-debt | the `Task:` trailer → `link.md` (`epic`, the story ID's prefix; `product-repo`, from the base — §8) → the Product epic's `thread`; every thread epic's `reconcile-debt.json` | `yad-change` (opens hotfix debt) |
| verified-commits | each commit's platform signature-verification status | the platform (GitHub/GitLab "Verified"); no author allowlist since E62 |
| commit-message | each non-merge commit's subject + trailer block | `yad-commit` / `CONTRIBUTING.md` (`config.yaml build.commit_subject_style`) |
| pr-title | the PR/MR title (from the CI event payload) | `yad-pr-template` (`config.yaml build.pr_title_style`) |
| pr-template | the PR/MR body (from the CI event payload) | `yad-pr-template` (the committed PR/MR template) |

## Resolving `<base>` (every gate that takes one)

The `<base>` argument is **optional**. The order is: the **argument**, else `SDLC_BASE`, else the
**configured** `default_branch` (from the Product settings file — see the next section), else the remote's
**published default branch** (`git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`), else `origin/main` —
the same order the CLI resolves (`cli/productcommit.mjs`, `cli/repo.mjs`), so a gate never diffs a
different range than the `yad` commands run beside it. Each candidate must actually **resolve**
before it is used, so a *dangling* `origin/HEAD` (trunk renamed, the old remote-tracking ref pruned)
falls through instead of failing the gate on a fully-fetched repo. CI always passes the base
explicitly (`origin/<PR base>` / `origin/$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TARGET_BRANCH_NAME`), so this governs
local runs.

Hardcoding `origin/main` diffed the wrong range on a repo whose trunk is `develop`/`master` — either
failing closed for the wrong reason, or, where a stale `main` still existed, silently diffing a range
that both mis-reports the surface and drags unrelated stories into contract-check's per-story fidelity
pass (issue #161). An auto-resolved base is **printed as a note**, so the range a local run gated is
never implicit. Like the `product-repo` block below, this one is duplicated verbatim across the
scripts (they are standalone by design) and pinned byte-identical by a test — which covers every
base-taking gate, including `yad-backfill`'s `backfill-check.sh` and the installed copies this repo's
own CI runs, plus an assertion that each one actually *assigns* `BASE` from it.

## Reading the Product settings (every gate that reads them)

The Product's settings live under two names until v5 (E122): `.sdlc/product.json` (read first) and
`.sdlc/hub.json` (the older name, which a gate from an older yadflow reads by path). yadflow writes both
with identical bytes. A gate picks the file in this order:

1. `SDLC_PRODUCT_CONFIG` — the environment variable to use.
2. `SDLC_HUB_CONFIG` — the older name, still honoured.
3. `.sdlc/product.json`.
4. `.sdlc/hub.json` — an older Product that has only that name.

The gate **FAILs**, and names both, when the two disagree:

- both variables are set and name files with different contents:
  `FAIL [product-settings]: SDLC_PRODUCT_CONFIG (…) and SDLC_HUB_CONFIG (…) name files that say different things. Set only SDLC_PRODUCT_CONFIG.`
- neither is set, and `.sdlc/product.json` and `.sdlc/hub.json` both exist with different bytes:
  `FAIL [product-settings]: .sdlc/product.json and .sdlc/hub.json say different things …`. Run
  `yad migrate --apply` in the Product (or `--apply --keep product` / `--keep hub`) to choose the copy
  to keep, and commit both. The CLI refuses the same case with `YAD-STATE-008`.

The `product_config` function is duplicated verbatim across the gates, like the base resolution above.
Every gate stops on its failure except **risk-map**, which is advisory: there a disagreement is a
`note [risk-map]: …` line, neither file is read, and the gate still passes (§10).

## 1. spec-link (`templates/checks/spec-link.sh`)

- Checks every non-merge commit in `<base>..HEAD` **per commit** (not aggregated across the range),
  so the report names each offending commit and one bad commit never masks the rest.
- Maintenance commits are **exempt**: a Conventional-Commits subject of type `ci`, `chore`, `build`,
  or `test` (optional `(scope)` / breaking `!`) **PASSes** without a link — CI wiring, dependency
  bumps, and test-infra changes legitimately link no story.
- The exemption waives the **requirement** for a link, never the **validity** of one that is claimed.
  A maintenance commit that *does* carry a `Task:` trailer is resolved like any other: a malformed id
  or a missing `specs/<story>/link.md` **FAILS**. Otherwise the trailer is decorative on exempt
  commits and an unlinked `chore:` is indistinguishable from one naming a story that never existed.
- For every other commit, requires a `Task: <story>-<task>` trailer. **FAIL** if absent.
- The trailer must be a well-formed `<story>-T<NN>` id. **FAIL** on a malformed trailer (e.g.
  `EP-demo-S01` with no `-T<NN>`) rather than letting it slip through the suffix-strip.
- Strips the `-T<NN>` suffix from the task to get `<story>`, which must be a story ID —
  `EP-<slug>-S<n>`, the slug in lowercase letters, digits and dashes (what `yad-stories` writes).
  **FAIL** by name otherwise (E117 review 1): a trailer of `EP-x-S01/.-T1` named
  `specs/EP-x-S01/./link.md`, which exists, and walked past the Product-reading gates. The four
  Product-reading gates apply the same pattern.
- Requires `specs/<story>/link.md` to exist. **FAIL** if missing.
- An empty range (no non-merge commits) **PASSes**.
- Portable across bash 3.2 (macOS) and 4+ (no `mapfile`).
- **Fails closed** when `<base>` can't be resolved (so a shallow clone / wrong base never PASSes blind).
  `<base>` is optional — see [Resolving `<base>`](#resolving-base-every-gate-that-takes-one).

## 2. contract-check (`templates/checks/contract-check.sh`)

- **Fails closed** if `<base>` can't be resolved — an undiffable range must never report "no surface
  change" and silently green-light a bypass. `<base>` is optional — see
  [Resolving `<base>`](#resolving-base-every-gate-that-takes-one).
- **Refuses any symlink or submodule under `specs/`** (E115), right after the base check and before
  any surface rule. The gate reads
  paths, and a link lets the content live where no path under `specs/` names it: a symlink at
  `specs`, `specs/<story>` or `specs/<story>/contracts` hid the slice from every rule, and so did every
  later edit to the link's target. A symlinked `link.md` redirects the lock pin the fidelity check
  reads. The check reads the **tree at HEAD** (`git ls-tree -r -z --full-tree HEAD`), not the diff, so
  a link merged before this check existed fails **every PR** in the repo until one PR removes it. It
  matches `specs` **without case**: on macOS and Windows `Specs/` is the same folder, and git's path
  filter matches exact bytes only. A top folder spelled any other way than `specs` (`Specs/`, `SPECS/`)
  is refused too, even when it holds plain files — the surface rules below are spelled in lowercase and
  would never see them. `ſpecs` (long s) counts as a second spelling: APFS folds it into `specs`.
  The same holds further down: a `contracts` folder spelled any other way (`Contracts/`, `CONTRACTS/`,
  `contractſ/`) is refused, and so are two story folders that are one name on a Mac
  (`specs/EP-x-S01/` and `specs/ep-x-s01/`) — one folder there, two to rules that read exact bytes.
  Names are folded as backfill-check folds them (E121): ASCII case plus the 13 characters a Mac folds
  into ASCII alone (U+00DF ß and U+1E9E ẞ as `ss`, U+017F ſ as `s`, U+212A Kelvin sign as `k`, the
  ligatures U+FB00–U+FB06 as their letters, U+037E and U+1FEF as `;` and `` ` ``), so
  `specs/EP-<Kelvin>iosk-S01/` beside `specs/EP-kiosk-S01/` is refused. Other letters are **not**
  caught: `specs/EP-démo-S01/` beside `specs/EP-DÉMO-S01/`, or the same name in NFC and NFD form, is one
  folder on a Mac and two here. Such a twin that holds a slice fails anyway: its folder is not a story
  ID (E117). The tree is read one record per line, with a newline inside a name written as `?`, so an
  odd file name cannot add a record.
  A file named exactly `specs` is refused too: the folder has to go there.
  **So a code repo that already has a `Specs/` folder or submodule (an iOS test folder, say), or a
  top-level file named `specs` in any case, fails every PR until it is renamed** — on a Mac checkout,
  `yad-spec` writing `specs/<story>/` would land inside it. `SPECS.md`, `Specs-old/` and a nested
  `foo/specs/` are not that folder and pass. A git that cannot read the tree fails the gate with a line
  that says so.
  `yad-spec` writes real files, so nothing legitimate lives there as a link. Removing a link under
  `contracts/` is a change to the surface and needs `Contract-Change: yes`; on a lockless epic it takes
  the removal hatch below. `yad doctor` warns `checks:symlink-blind` for an older copy without this check.
- Computes the changed files as **what merging the branch into the target would change** (issue #363):
  `git merge-tree --write-tree <base> HEAD` (git 2.38+) builds that merge without touching anything, and
  the diff runs from the target to it — what GitHub's own merge checkout gives. The quote pass reads the
  slice's content, and the "whole slice removed" check its tree, from that result too. Why the merge and
  not a simpler range:
  - a two-dot diff compared with the target's tip, so a slice that landed on the target after the branch
    split off failed a branch that never touched it;
  - a diff from the merge base reads from ONE merge base when there are several (a hotfix merged into
    both, stacked branches, a criss-cross merge), so a hand-resolved merge could undo what the other
    side brought in (review 1);
  - and it misses a **rename** on the target: the real merge follows it, so an edit to a file the target
    moved into a slice (or a backfilled feature) lands there unseen (review 4).

  The trailer is still read from `git log <base>..HEAD` (this branch's own commits), and so are the
  slice files **the branch's own commits touch** (merge commits left out, the full history read so a
  merged side's commits are not dropped): they count as touched even when the merge nets them to nothing
  (review 5, the user's decision). A GitHub "Rebase and merge" replays each commit, so a commit that
  mirrors the target's re-lock and a later one that undoes it would land the undo while the merge shows
  no change. So when the branch's own commits touch a slice, **the quote proof also needs the branch
  rebased onto the target, with no merge commits** (review 6): then every merge method lands the branch
  tip, which is the merge the gate reads, and the proof is exact. Otherwise the gate says to rebase (or
  add the trailer). Both paths read the `link.md` that lands, from the merge. A story "only removes" its
  slice when every slice path it touches is gone from what lands.
  A branch that does not merge cleanly **FAILS** closed (the platform cannot merge it either): merge the
  target into it. A base that shares no history with HEAD (a shallow clone), or a merge git cannot build
  (a missing object), **FAILS** closed. **Older git** (before 2.38) falls back to the merge base,
  `<base>...HEAD`, and fails closed when there is more than one, or when the target **removed or moved**
  a file the branch modifies (no rename detection: its limits differ from the merge's).
- The surface is `specs/<story>/contracts` **and** everything under it: a path that IS
  `specs/<story>/contracts` (a link being removed) counts too.
- If **nothing** under `specs/*/contracts/**` changed → **PASS** (normal implementation only *consumes*
  the contract).
- If the surface slice changed:
  - Require a `Contract-Change: yes` trailer. **FAIL** (route back to the architecture gate) if absent —
    **unless every touched story's slice is an exact quote** (issue #344). A story's slice is a quote
    when all of these hold, and the failure lists each one that does not:
    - the story's folder is a story ID and its `link.md` is there;
    - the Product is reached (the same resolution as below) and its `contract-lock.json` is readable;
    - `link.md` pins that lock's hash;
    - the Product's `epics/<epic>/contract.md` still hashes to the lock (the `CONTRACT-SURFACE` recipe),
      so the lines are compared with the **locked** text, not a later edit. A change-epic that inherits
      its architecture has a **pointer lock** (`inheritedFrom` / `ref`) and no `contract.md`: the owner's
      `contract.md` is read instead, only inside the Product's `epics/`, and only while the owner's lock
      still holds the copied hash. An epic that re-authored its architecture and kept the pointer fields
      has its own `contract.md`, and that is read (`yad doctor` reads it too, and also warns about the
      leftover fields);
    - no slice file is deleted (a deletion changes the surface);
    - every changed slice file is **Markdown** (`.md`; any other file under `contracts/` needs the
      trailer), read from the commit by its exact name (a name holding a newline, or content holding a
      zero byte, is refused), and holds **exactly one** `<!-- CONTRACT-QUOTE:BEGIN -->` …
      `<!-- CONTRACT-QUOTE:END -->` block, not empty. Its non-blank lines (trailing spaces and a CR
      ignored) are **one unbroken run of the locked surface's non-blank lines, in its order** — lines
      checked one by one could be reordered into a different meaning (review 1), and two blocks, each a
      run, could be stitched into one (review 2); to quote two parts, use two files. Outside the block the
      file holds only blank lines and, as its first non-blank line, the optional title
      `# Contract slice — <story ID>` (exactly that text; a leading BOM is ignored): a note there was never
      read, so a new endpoint written in it passed (review 1), and a free title could say anything
      (review 2). Notes go in `spec.md` or `plan.md`.
    A prose slice from before this rule has no block, so it still needs the trailer until `yad-spec`
    rewrites it.
  - Best-effort fidelity: when the product repo is reachable (via `link.md`'s `product-repo` path),
    require `link.md`'s pinned `contract-lock` hash to match the product repo's current
    `contract-lock.json`. A claimed change that still pins the **old** lock **FAILS** — re-run
    `yad-spec` so the slice matches the re-locked contract. **Where** the lock is read from is not the
    PR's to choose (E117) — see "Resolving `product-repo`" in §8.
  - Each story's slice must sit under a story ID (`specs/EP-<slug>-S<n>/contracts/`) and come with its
    `specs/<story>/link.md` — `yad-spec` writes the two together. A slice that is **added or changed**
    without them **FAILS** by name (E117 review 2): deleting `link.md` used to drop a stale pin, and a
    Spec Kit folder such as `specs/001-name/contracts/` can be tied to no lock. A non-story folder
    whose changed files are all **deletions** passes, so it can always be cleaned up. A story may drop
    its `link.md` only when its **whole** slice is gone at HEAD (review 3): deleting `link.md` with part
    of a slice left the rest with nothing pinning it. This closes the deferral E115 stated as a cost.
  - When the Product folder **was reached** and has no `epics/<epic>/`, the slice is an **orphan** and
    **FAILS** — it used to say "not reachable" and defer. Removing an orphan's slice (deletions only)
    passes: no lock exists for it to contradict.
  - The fidelity check runs for **every story whose slice the diff touches**, and **aggregates**: each
    story reports (matched / stale / deferred), and any stale pin fails the gate. `git diff
    --name-only` is path-sorted, so reading one story off the first changed path validated whichever
    story sorted first and left the rest unpinned — a later story pinning a stale hash passed, and a
    first story with no `link.md` deferred the whole check before the stale one was ever read
    (issue #161). One clean-or-deferred story never masks another's stale pin, the same rule spec-link
    applies per commit. (A story with no `link.md` now FAILs rather than defers — see above.)
  - A lock the gate can **read but not parse** (truncated, half-written, or a changed schema — no
    `"hash": "sha256:…"`) **FAILS**. It used to short-circuit the comparison into the "hash matches"
    note, i.e. the gate affirmatively reported a match it never made.
- The changed-file list is read with `git diff --no-renames --name-only -z` (E114):
  - `--no-renames` lists a rename by **both** paths — a delete of the old one and an add of the new.
    Without it git names a rename by its new path only, so `git mv specs/S1/contracts/api.md
    docs/api.md` took the slice off the surface and passed with no `Contract-Change` trailer.
  - `-z` (NUL-separated) means git never quotes a path. By default git quotes a path holding a
    non-ASCII byte, and it quotes one holding a `"` or a tab even with `core.quotePath=false` — so a
    slice like `specs/EP-démo-S01/contracts/…` never matched the surface pattern.
  - The script runs with `LC_ALL=C` (bytes, not characters), so a file name that is not valid UTF-8
    cannot make GNU grep drop the list on Linux CI.
  - The list of **deleted** slice paths (the lockless escape hatch above) is built the same way, so
    moving a slice out of `contracts/` under a lockless epic is still a removal.
  - `yad doctor` warns `checks:rename-blind` when an installed `checks/contract-check.sh` (or
    `checks/backfill-check.sh`) in the Product or a connected repo still lists a rename by one path —
    a copy changed by hand, which `yad check --fix` keeps.
- This enforces the Phase 2 rule: the shared surface is owned upstream and is never widened from inside
  a code repo. The hash recipe is in `../yad-architecture/references/contract-format.md`.

## 3. build/test/lint (`templates/checks/build-test-lint.sh`)

- Reads the standard `package.json#packageManager` field and runs `lint`, `build`, and `test` through
  that manager in order; any non-zero exit fails the gate. `npm` and `pnpm` are supported; another
  manager (yarn, bun) fails closed unless an npm lockfile is present, in which case the repo stays on
  the historical npm path with a warning — a yarn-locally, npm-in-CI repo was green before this
  field was read and must not go red on upgrade. A repo
  without the field retains npm behavior unless it carries `pnpm-lock.yaml` and no npm lockfile
  (`package-lock.json` / `npm-shrinkwrap.json`) — a repo with both keeps the npm path rather than
  silently changing toolchains.
- CI runs `install-deps.sh` first. A declared npm or pnpm manager must use a full, exact semantic
  version with either no build metadata or Corepack's integrity suffix,
  `+<sha1|sha224|sha256|sha384|sha512>.<lowercase hex digest>` at that algorithm's digest length
  (Corepack hashes the download with the named algorithm and compares the lowercase hex string).
  Other build metadata, digest algorithms, digest lengths, uppercase digests, or trailing
  identifiers fail closed. The installer activates the declared version through
  Corepack. Pinned npm is dispatched through Corepack — `corepack npm ci` here and `corepack npm run`
  in the gate, since Corepack activates npm but never shims it — so Node's ambient npm cannot
  override the declaration anywhere; packageManager-absent npm preserves the historical `npm ci` path. pnpm uses
  `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. Partial versions, ranges, and tags also fail closed instead of
  floating to a different toolchain.
- The build/test/lint job defaults to Node 22. Set the GitHub repository variable or GitLab
  project/group CI/CD variable `YAD_NODE_VERSION` when the repo requires another supported Node
  release; generated files remain managed instead of accumulating consumer-specific edits. The
  variable is read by the code repo's `yad-checks` workflow only (on GitHub the build/test/lint job;
  in the GitLab fragment it sets the `node:` image of every `yad-*` gate job, which all share one
  anchor) — the Product-side workflows run the `yad` CLI, not the repo's toolchain, and keep their own
  pinned Node. A declared `packageManager` needs
  Corepack, which ships with Node 18 through 24 (Node 25+ dropped it) and, before 18.20.7 / 20.19 /
  22.14, carries registry keys too old to verify anything published since 2025 — so the override
  should stay on a current 20, 22 or 24 line (or install a current Corepack first). The installer
  checks for the binary and wraps `corepack prepare`, so both an absent and a stale Corepack fail
  with that guidance instead of a bare "command not found" or "Cannot find matching keyid".
- Tests must actually exercise behavior (build plan §C) — an empty or trivially-passing suite does not
  satisfy the gate's intent.
- **Test worker cap.** When the CI job sets `YAD_TEST_MAX_WORKERS` (the templates default it to `2`)
  and the repo's `test` script is jest/vitest, the gate forwards `--maxWorkers=<n>` to bound CI
  concurrency (as `-- --maxWorkers=<n>` under npm, which consumes the separator, and bare under pnpm,
  which would forward a literal `--` to the script). For any other runner (`node --test`, mocha, …)
  it is a no-op — the flag is never passed, so the gate cannot break on an unknown option. Override it per repo via the
  `YAD_TEST_MAX_WORKERS` CI variable, or unset it to remove the cap.

### Canonical `package.json` scripts (Node demo)

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "find src -name '*.js' -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 node --check",
    "build": "true",
    "test": "node --test"
  }
}
```

`node --check` is a real syntax lint with no extra dependency; `node --test` is Node 20+'s built-in
runner. Real repos substitute their own eslint/tsc/jest — the gate only calls the scripts.

## 4. verified-commits (`templates/checks/verified-commits.sh`)

No unsigned commits reach merge — on the Product and on every connected repo. For each commit in
`<base>..HEAD`, one check:

- **Verified signature** — the platform must mark the commit's signature verified (the GitHub/GitLab
  "Verified" badge: signed with a GPG/SSH key registered to the account owning the author email).
  Read via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/<sha>` (GitHub) or the commits/signature API (GitLab).

**There is no author allowlist** (E62). yadflow keeps no list of people: write access to the repo
decides who can author, and the signature proves which platform account made the commit. `yad check --fix`
and `yad setup` no longer generate `.sdlc/verified-authors`, and no gate reads it or the Product settings'
`verified_authors` any more (`SDLC_VERIFIED_AUTHORS` is gone too). When an old `.sdlc/verified-authors`
file is still on disk, the gate prints:

```
note [verified-commits]: .sdlc/verified-authors is no longer read — write access to the repo decides who can author; the signature is still required.
```

`yad doctor` warns `people:verified-authors-unused` for the same leftover data; nothing deletes it.
The old allowlist waivers for the `yad-gate-sync` bot and for merge commits are gone too, because there
is no allowlist left to waive. A bot commit inside the checked range needs a Verified signature like any
other commit.

**Content-free merge exemption** (unchanged). A merge commit (2+ parents) is **signature-waived when it
introduces no content of its own** (its combined diff — `git diff-tree --cc` — is empty, i.e. no
conflict-resolution or evil-merge hunks): every change it carries already lives in an individually
signature-checked parent, so there is nothing to protect. This unblocks **self-hosted GitLab**, which
does not sign UI-created merge commits (the signature API returns 404) — without it every routine merge
would red the branch. A merge that *does* introduce content of its own still requires a verified
signature (fail-closed), so an evil merge pushed direct-to-default cannot smuggle in unverified changes.
This matters for the push-on-default `yad-update-guard` (§9), which — unlike this PR-triggered gate —
sees merge commits.

Degradation is explicit, never silent: no GitHub/GitLab remote SKIPs the signature check (the badge is a
platform concept — this keeps local runs and tests meaningful); an unreachable platform API **fails
closed** with guidance. GitLab CI needs a `GITLAB_TOKEN`/`SDLC_API_TOKEN` variable with `read_api` —
`CI_JOB_TOKEN` cannot read the signature API.

Note the deliberate split with the gate-sync bot: this gate runs on **PRs/MRs only**, so the
`yad-gate-sync` ledger commits (pushed directly to the default branch, unsigned, bot-authored) are
not subject to it. Do **not** replace it with a platform-level "reject unsigned pushes" rule on the
default branch — that would break the event-driven gate sync (and GitLab push rules are Premium-only).

## 5. commit-message (`templates/checks/commit-message.sh`)

The commit *pattern* gate (the presence-only `Task:` check is spec-link's; this checks SHAPE). For each
non-merge commit in `<base>..HEAD`:

- **Subject** must be `<type>: <description>` with `<type>` a known Conventional-Commits type
  (`feat|fix|docs|refactor|test|perf|build|ci|chore|revert` — keep in sync with `cli/manifest.mjs`
  `COMMIT_TYPES`) and **no trailing period** — mirroring `cli/commit.mjs` `buildCommitMessage`.
- **Trailers**, when present, appear in the fixed order `Task → Contract-Change → Ledger-Override →
  Co-Authored-By` (`Ledger-Override` only from `yad commit --manual --reason`; this gate does not check it).
- Merge/squash commits (2+ parents) are skipped — their platform-generated subjects are not authored.
- **Profiles** (`--profile code|product`; `hub`, the old name for `product`, still works): the subject rule is identical on both; the gate never requires
  the `Task:` trailer (spec-link owns that on code repos; Product commits are not task-scoped).
- **Fails closed** when `<base>` can't be resolved.
  `<base>` is optional — see [Resolving `<base>`](#resolving-base-every-gate-that-takes-one).

## 6. pr-title (`templates/checks/pr-title.sh`)

The PR/MR title must follow the convention for the repo kind (title passed as the arg, injected by CI
from the event payload):

- `--profile code` (default) → a Conventional-Commits subject `<type>: <description>`, no trailing
  period (`config.yaml build.pr_title_style: same_as_commit_subject` — one task = one PR, the title is
  the squash-merge subject).
- `--profile product` (old name `hub`, still accepted) → splits by the PR/MR **head branch** (passed via `--head`, injected by CI):
  - `review/EP-*` head (or no `--head` — stays strict) → a Shape artifact-review title
    `review: <artifact> (EP-<slug>)`, the shape `yad gate open` creates.
  - any other head → a tooling/code change to the Product itself, so it follows the `code` convention (a
    Conventional-Commits subject). This is what lets a PR that changes the Product's own workflows/checks
    pass — it has no EP artifact to review.
  - **Anti-bypass guard.** The branch name alone is not trusted: a non-review head that actually
    changes Shape artifacts (any path under `epics/**` or `foundation/**`) **FAILS** — those changes must go through
    a `review/EP-*` PR and the artifact-review workflow. The message says how: move them to a
    `review/<epic>/<artifact>` branch (`review/EP-foundation/foundation` for the Foundation) and run
    `yad open-pr` from it, or drop them from the PR. CI passes the PR's changed paths via
    `--changed <file>` (computed from the diff against the base ref); without that list (a direct
    by-hand caller) the guard is inert and the branch split alone applies. A step owner file
    (`epics/<epic>/.sdlc/owners/<step>.json`, `foundation/.sdlc/owners/…`, written by `yad assign`,
    E47) is not a Shape artifact: a PR that changes only owner files passes on any branch. The
    workflow builds the list with `--no-renames` (and `core.quotePath=false`), so a rename INTO
    `owners/` still lists the artifact it removed. A path git still C-quotes (a `"`, `\`, tab or
    newline in its name) counts as an artifact change and never as an owner file. Both greps run with
    `LC_ALL=C grep -a`, so a path with bytes that are not valid UTF-8 is never dropped from the list.

## 7. pr-template (`templates/checks/pr-template.sh`)

The PR/MR body must actually USE the committed template (body passed as a file, injected by CI) — this
catches a free-form description that bypassed it:

- `--profile code` (default) → requires `## Summary`, `## Impact & Risk`, `## Checklist`, and a filled
  `Risk level:` (`low|medium|high`).
- `--profile product` (old name `hub`, still accepted) → splits by the PR/MR **head branch** (passed via `--head`, injected by CI):
  - `review/EP-*` head (or no `--head`) → requires the artifact-review template: `## Artifact under
    review`, `## Impact & Risk (front-half)` (or `(Shape)`), `## Checklist`, and a `Risk tags:` line.
  - any other head → a Product tooling PR, so it requires the `code` task template (`## Summary`,
    `## Impact & Risk`, `## Checklist`, filled `Risk level:`).
  - **Anti-bypass guard** (same as pr-title): a non-review head that changes Shape artifacts
    (`epics/**` or `foundation/**`, detected from the CI-supplied `--changed <file>` list) **FAILS** — artifact changes
    must go through a `review/EP-*` PR, and the message says how, as in pr-title. Step owner files alone do not count (E47).

**GitLab truncates the description this gate reads.** `$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_DESCRIPTION` stops at **2700
characters**, so a long but perfectly valid MR can lose a required section *before the gate sees it* —
the author then reads "does not use the template" while looking at a description that visibly contains
it (#164). GitHub is unaffected (`github.event.pull_request.body` is not truncated). Three mitigations,
all shipped:

- **the gate reads the whole description (#343).** In GitLab CI, when GitLab says it cut the description
  (`CI_MERGE_REQUEST_DESCRIPTION_IS_TRUNCATED`) or the text it was handed has reached 2700 characters, the
  gate reads it again in full from the merge request API
  (`$CI_API_V4_URL/projects/$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_PROJECT_ID/merge_requests/$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID`) and checks
  that instead. The token is the `GITLAB_TOKEN` (or `SDLC_API_TOKEN`) CI/CD variable — the same
  `read_api` token `yad-verified-commits` already needs — or, without one, the job's own `CI_JOB_TOKEN`,
  which GitLab's job-token access list allows on a single merge request (an older GitLab may not). It goes to `curl` in a header file, never on
  its command line, and only to that GitLab's own API; `node` decodes the answer. If the full text
  cannot be read (no token that works, no `curl` or `node`, no answer), the cut body is checked as
  before and the note below also says why and to set `GITLAB_TOKEN`. A fork's pipeline runs in the fork
  and cannot read the target project's merge request; its note says so, and only the order of the
  sections helps there. The API answers with the description as it is now, so a job re-run after the
  author edits a long description checks the edit (a short one is read from the pipeline's variable);

- the GitLab MR templates (`yad-pr-template` `templates/gitlab/…` and `templates/product/gitlab/…`) carry
  the constraint as a comment and keep every required section early, so a truncated body still passes;
- when a required section is missing **and** the body it read was cut (GitLab's flag, or ≥ 2700
  characters) and the full text could not be read, the gate prints a `NOTE` naming the truncation, why
  the full text was not read and, only where a token change can help, what to change (no variable and a
  refusal: set `GITLAB_TOKEN`, or in a fork, that a fork cannot read the target's MR; a variable that is
  set: 401 renew or replace it, 403 give it `read_api`, 404 its user cannot see the project; a timeout, a
  5xx or an odd answer: the reason alone), and the fix — reorder the required sections above the cutoff and push
  the long narrative to the end. Never delete a section: reordering is always allowed.

## 8. Phase 6 — feature-thread gates (`lineage-check.sh`, `epic-open.sh`, `reconcile-debt-check.sh`)

After the contract locks and code ships, a change must not mutate a locked artifact — it becomes a new
epic threaded to its parent (`config.yaml` `change:`). These three gates keep that discipline. All three
resolve the owning epic the same way: `Task:` trailer → `specs/<story>/link.md` (`epic` + `product-repo`)
→ the Product epic. All **fail closed** on an unresolvable base; all are **per commit**; `ci|chore|build|test`
commits **with no `Task:` trailer** are exempt — like spec-link, the exemption waives the requirement
for an owning epic, never the validity of one that is claimed, so a maintenance subject cannot buy a
pass past the sealed-epic / orphan-thread / frozen-thread checks. When the **Product is not reachable** from CI (the usual case for a code-repo
PR), each degrades to a **PASS-with-note** — the Product-side check (`yad doctor` / `yad reconcile`) covers
that path, and spec-link still proves the story link.

**Resolving `product-repo` (shared by all four Product-reading gates, contract-check included).** An
**absolute** value is used as-is; a **relative** value is joined to the `link.md`'s own directory,
`specs/<story>/`, falling back to a repo-root reading when only that resolves (what contract-check
historically did, so `link.md` files written for it keep working). The `link.md` itself is read from
its frontmatter block, falling back to a whole-file scan for a pre-frontmatter one. Every gate applies
the identical rule — when they disagree, a value one gate can resolve becomes an unreachable path for
another, and "unreachable" is a PASS-with-note, so the gate silently stops gating (issue #149). Each
gate now **prints that note**, so a deferred check is never mistaken for a passed one. The block is
duplicated verbatim across the four scripts (they are standalone by design) and a test asserts the
four copies stay byte-identical.

**The PR under check does not choose where the Product is read from (E117).** `link.md` is a file the
PR's own author writes. Before E117 a PR could point `product-repo` at a path that does not exist — the
gate called the Product "not reachable" and passed — or at a folder it committed itself, holding a
hand-made `contract-lock.json` with the hash it pins. Two rules close both:

| Rule | What the gate does | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The repo's **record** comes first (E120) | `.sdlc/product-link.json` in the code repo — `git_url`, `path` (from the repo root: where CI checks the Product out, `.yad/product` by default) and `default_branch` — is written by `yad check --fix` / `yad update` from the Product and merged on its own. Read from the **base**, its `path` wins over every `link.md`: no gate takes where the Product lives from the PR. A record the PR adds or changes counts once it merges (a note says so). A `link.md` whose own `product-repo` reaches a **different** folder here gets a note; one that reaches nothing (a path on its author's machine) is passed over in silence. When the record's path reaches nothing — a developer's own run, where nobody cloned into it — the base's `link.md` order below is used if **it** reaches a folder (still the base's, never the PR's); otherwise the record stands and the gate **defers** (CI has no Product checkout) — it is not the PR's choice, so E119's first-spec FAIL does not apply. With no record on the base, the order below is kept. | A record is one reviewed fact for the whole repo, where `link.md` is one per story and written by each PR's author. |
| `product-repo` comes from the **base** | Where the Product lives is a fact about the whole repo, so the value is, in order: `link.md` as it stands on the base; else a sibling `specs/<story>/link.md` on the base (a story new in this PR, or a `link.md` that never had a value) — one of the same epic first, and the first whose value reaches a folder here, so one stale `link.md` cannot hand every new story a deferral; else — the repo's first spec — the PR's value. A PR whose value differs gets a note (`… names product-repo 'Y', but specs/<other>/link.md on main says 'X' — the Product is read from the base value; a new one counts once it merges`). | Only `product-repo` is read from the base. `contract-lock` is read as the PR leaves it — a re-spec PR must update the pin. |
| A **kept** Product is read from the **base commit** | Whether the Product is kept in this repo (a monorepo: the Product and the code in one git repo) is asked of the **base**, from the path's text alone, before anything on disk: the base tracks `<path>/.sdlc/product.json` or `<path>/.sdlc/hub.json` (both, until v5), which every Product commits. The disk is the PR's — a PR that deleted or moved the folder read as untracked, and deferred. Its `epics/` is then written out from the base commit through a throwaway index (`git read-tree` + `git checkout-index`), with the work tree pointed at an empty temp folder, and read from there. Not `git archive`, which drops whatever `.gitattributes` marks `export-ignore`; and not with the real work tree, whose `.gitattributes` is the PR's — `*.md text eol=crlf` or `working-tree-encoding=UTF-16` there wrote the base's files unreadable. A symlink or submodule inside the base's `epics/` is **FAIL** by name: a link written out still points where it pointed (an absolute one into the PR's working tree), and a submodule comes out as an empty folder. Any other tracked file under a Product path — a planted folder, or one file force-added under an ignored checkout — **FAILs** by name, with the fix (`git rm -r --cached`). A path that runs through a tracked symlink, submodule or file: **FAIL** by name. The path is walked twice — part by part as written, and again from where it really lands, resolved in one step from the gate's own shell — so an alias such as Linux's `/proc/self/cwd`, which means a different folder to each process, cannot lead the gate into the PR's own tree (review 5). A folder that is there but cannot be entered to find where it really is **FAILs** rather than being read unchecked (review 6). A path whose real location is inside the repo's own git folder also **FAILs**: git never lists `.git/` as tracked, yet branch names shape the folders in it (review 7). The git folder is compared as a folder, not a spelling, so `.GIT` counts on a disk that ignores case (review 8). | "Inside the code repo" is not the test. CI can only check a second repo out inside the workspace (`actions/checkout` `path:`), and an untracked checkout there is not the PR's. |
| One story ID shape | A story must be `EP-<slug>-S<n>` (lowercase slug), in all four gates and spec-link. **FAIL** by name otherwise. | A story written as a path (`EP-x-S01/.`) named a `link.md` the base read never found. |

The costs, stated: in a monorepo the Product is read from the base, so a PR that re-locks the contract
**and** changes the slice fails the pin check — merge the re-lock first, the rule the gate already states
("re-locked upstream first"); and a PR that adds a new epic or story **and** its code fails
contract-check, lineage-check, epic-open and reconcile-debt as an orphan — merge the Product change
first. When `product-repo` reaches **nothing** — neither a kept Product by its text nor any folder on
disk — a Product the base keeps (a tracked `.sdlc/product.json` or `.sdlc/hub.json` with an `epics/` folder beside it) that holds
the story's epic is the one read: a value spelled past the repo's own folder name, or another machine's
absolute path, cannot be folded to it, and a PR that deleted or moved it left nothing on disk to walk
(review 3). Only then, and only one holding the epic (review 4): a kept Product used to win over the
real checkout, so a merged test fixture shaped like a Product was read instead. Two that hold it
**FAIL**. In a two-repo setup whose CI checks nothing out, a fixture that does hold the epic is read
where the gate used to defer — no weaker than that deferral. A kept Product's `.gitattributes` entries
are dropped before it is written out. Frontmatter is read with CR
stripped before the `---` fences are matched, so a CRLF Product reads the same as an LF one. The case of a path is folded only where git folds it
(`core.ignorecase`, a Mac checkout), and in ASCII only. A Product absent from CI still defers with a note, as
before — with one exception in contract-check (E119): on a repo's **first spec**, where no `link.md` on the
base names a Product and `product-repo` is the PR's own value, a diff that changes a slice and whose
`product-repo` reaches nothing **FAILs** by name ("… is this repo's first spec …", then "… reaches
nothing", or "… names no product-repo" when `link.md` has none). A Product that IS reached — checked out, or
kept in this repo and read from the base — but holds the epic's folder with no ledger in it still defers:
it is not "nowhere", and the PR cannot shape a base copy. A first
spec with no slice is unchanged (the surface is read from paths alone), and so is one that only removes a
slice. **Cost:** a repo whose CI does not check out the Product cannot merge a first spec that carries a
slice until it does. The other three gates judge the epic, not the surface, and still defer there (E120). `yad doctor` warns `checks:product-path-blind` for an older copy of any of the four.

**The PR does not choose the epic either (E118).** lineage-check, epic-open and reconcile-debt-check
read `epic:` from `link.md`. It must equal the story ID's prefix — story `EP-checkout-S01` belongs to
epic `EP-checkout`, which is what `yad-spec` writes. Any other value — an empty or missing one
included — **FAILs** by name. Before E118 a
story of a sealed epic could name an open one and pass epic-open. contract-check has always worked the
epic out from the story ID.

- **lineage-check** — reads the Product epic's work-item type and `parent` frontmatter. The type has
  two names and the gate reads `kind:` first, then `type:` — the same order the CLI uses, asserted by a
  table test in `cli/test-checks.mjs`. A `feature` or `chore` (genesis) epic
  passes. A `change`/`defect`/`hotfix` epic **FAILS** unless it declares a `parent:` that resolves to a
  real `epics/<parent>/` in the Product (no orphan threads). This is the "every code change has an owning
  epic in a thread" enforcement, layered on spec-link.
- **epic-open** — an epic is **sealed** iff it has ≥1 story and **every** `stories/*.md` `status:` is
  `shipped`. A commit whose owning epic is sealed **FAILS**: new behaviour cannot mutate a shipped epic;
  it must land in a new threaded change-epic. This is what stops the Shape artifacts from going stale.
- **reconcile-debt** — resolves the epic's `thread` (its `thread:` frontmatter, else the epic id) and
  scans every thread epic's `reconcile-debt.json`. A Product that was reached with no such epic **FAILs** as an orphan story
  link, as lineage-check and epic-open do (E117 review 2). An **open** entry the current epic does not own
  **FAILS** the change (the thread is frozen until the hotfix debt is paid: artifacts updated + a
  regression test added, then `status: paid`). Thread-scoped — only the affected thread freezes.

## 9. yad-update-guard (`templates/github/yad-update-guard.yml`, `templates/gitlab/yad-update-guard.gitlab-ci.yml`)

The **integrity gate for direct pushes to the default branch**. `yad update --push` (`cli/update-commit.mjs`)
commits the applied SDLC drift (skills, gate scripts, CI wiring) and pushes it
**straight to the default branch with no PR/MR** — so the `pull_request`/`merge_request` gate suite never
fires. This workflow is the "skipped from CI **except** verified-commits + the pattern gate" contract: on a
**push** to the default branch it runs **only** `verified-commits` and `commit-message` over the pushed
range (`github.event.before..HEAD` / `$CI_COMMIT_BEFORE_SHA..HEAD`, falling back to `HEAD~1` when the
before-SHA is a zero/unresolvable ref). It is deliberately **not** scoped to `chore(yad-update)` commits:
**any** direct-to-default commit (a hotfix, a force-push) is then signature- + subject-format-checked, a
strictly-good invariant. Normal PR merges sail through — merge commits are platform-Verified and
`commit-message` skips merges. The `yad update --push` commit itself carries **no `[skip ci]`** (unlike the
machine-state `yad checkpoint`/`gate ci` commits) precisely so this guard runs on it.

Wired into **every connected repo and the Product** (`REPO_WIRING`/`PRODUCT_WIRING` in `cli/manifest.mjs`). On
GitHub it is a self-contained workflow (`.github/workflows/yad-update-guard.yml`, marker `# yad-managed:
yad-checks`), gated to the default branch by a job-level `if: github.ref_name ==
github.event.repository.default_branch`. On GitLab it is an includable fragment
(`.gitlab/ci/yad-update-guard.yml`, marker `# yad-managed-include: yad-checks`) whose jobs run on
`$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "push" && $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH`; its `include:` line
(`- local: '.gitlab/ci/yad-update-guard.yml'`) is added to the root `.gitlab-ci.yml` the same additive way
as the other fragments (see *Sync with existing CI* below). **On GitLab the fragment is inert until that
include line exists** — `yad update --push` warns when it pushes to a gitlab repo whose root pipeline
lacks it.

**Prerequisites / caveats.** Direct pushes to the default branch must be permitted for the committer
(adjust branch protection). The commits `yad update --push` creates must be **signed**, or this guard
rejects them — `yad update --push` runs a pre-flight that warns when local commit signing is off. Ordinary
PR merges pass (merge commits are Verified, or content-free and signature-waived), but a **rebase-merge**
recreates the PR commits
without the platform signature, so a rebase-merge team should sign commits or not wire this guard.

## 10. risk-map (`templates/checks/risk-map-check.sh`) — advisory

Reads the code repo's **risk map**, `.sdlc/risk-map`: one line per directory giving it a level (`high`,
`medium`, `low`, or `unset`), marked `guessed` (an AI agent filled it) or `confirmed` (a person checked
it), and **no names** (E65). The format, the rubric and who may change what:
`../yad-connect-repos/references/risk-map.md`. The rules have a twin in `cli/riskmap.mjs`
(`yad risk-map check`, `yad doctor`); a test runs both over the same repos and compares the output.

It **always exits 0**: the count it prints is reported, never enforced — the platform's branch
protection holds a Build merge. It cannot apply the capacity cap (E72) either: the cap needs the
Product's count of active people, which a code repo's CI does not have; `yad open-pr` shows the capped
count. So a stale map must never block a merge. It prints `WARN [risk-map] <code> <target>: …` for:

| Code | When |
|---|---|
| `uncovered` | a file this change adds or edits that no line covers — names the directory to add. A directory a line cannot hold (`app/[slug]/`) names its parent instead; a top-level one (`my docs/`) says to rename it |
| `dead` | a line whose directory holds no file (`./`: no file at the root) — on every change, until fixed |
| `unset` / `guessed` | a line this change touches that has no level yet, or whose level is still a guess |
| `unreadable` / `names` / `duplicate` | a line that is not `<dir>/ <level> <state>`, names a person (a word starting `@`, `@org/team` included — a word ending in `/`, like `@types/`, is a directory), or repeats a directory |
| `header` / `version` | no `# yad-risk-map v1` first line (read as v1), or a newer version (nothing is read) |
| `map-edited` | the change edits the map itself, which decides how much review later changes need |

The change is `git diff --name-only -z --diff-filter=ACMRT <base>...HEAD` (T: a file turned into a symlink is an edit) — **three dots**, measured from
where the branch left the base, so commits the base gained since are never blamed on this change (the
blocking gates use two dots; this one only warns about what the change touches). A deleted file is never
asked about. The repo is `git ls-files -z`. Both lists are read NUL-separated, so a path holding `"`, `\`
or a tab arrives as it is, never quoted by git. A base that does not resolve, or shares no history with HEAD (a shallow clone), is a note, not a failure:
the map's own lines are still checked. A repo with no map gets one note and passes — **unless this change deleted
the map**, which warns `map-edited`: a rename away from `.sdlc/risk-map`, and the map replaced by a folder or by a symlink that leads nowhere or to a folder, count as a delete. A symlink to a real file is not — `[ -f ]` follows it, so the check reads the link's target as the map and says `edits`. Deleting some other file under a *folder* named `.sdlc/risk-map/` gets the plain no-map note, not `map-edited`. Outside a git repo it
prints a note and exits 0. **Known limits:** a path holding a newline reads differently here than in
`yad risk-map check` — git's NUL-separated list has to become lines for macOS awk — and such a directory
cannot have a line anyway. A path whose bytes are not valid UTF-8 differs too: this check compares bytes
(`LC_ALL=C`), while the CLI decodes bad bytes as U+FFFD. **The map file is not wired** — it is the
team's, so `yad update` never owns or overwrites it; only the check is.

**The count (E66).** Before the warnings it prints one line saying how many approvers the change asks for:

```
COUNT [risk-map]: 2 approvers = base 1 + high risk 1 (high on origin/main: src/payments/ (guessed)) — reported, not enforced: branch protection holds the merge.
COUNT [risk-map]: 1 approver = base 1 — nothing this change touches is high on origin/main.
```

- The map is read from the **base branch's tip** (`git show <base>:.sdlc/risk-map`), never from the
  change's copy — so a change cannot lower its own count by editing or deleting the map. The warnings
  above still read the change's copy, because they are about keeping that copy true.
- Only a real file on the base is read. A symlink or a folder with that name is treated as no map.
- The change's files for the count are `git diff --name-only -z --no-renames <base>...HEAD`, **with no
  filter**: a deleted file, and a file moved away, count where they were. Deleting code in a `high`
  directory is a `high` change. (The warnings keep `--diff-filter=ACMRT`: a deleted file cannot be
  uncovered.)
- A `guessed` level counts as a `confirmed` one. `medium` is printed on its own line and adds nothing.
  An `unset` line, and a file no line covers, add nothing.
- The base has no map: `1 approver = base 1 — '<base>' has no .sdlc/risk-map, so no directory adds a step.` The base does not resolve,
  shares no history with HEAD, or holds a map for a newer version: **no COUNT line**, and a note that the
  count is unknown, not zero.

**Who can meet the ask (E67).** Under the count, the check names the people who have committed in the
last 30 days in the `high` directories this change touches. With two such directories it is ONE list:
someone who has worked in any of them meets the ask, and the output never says who worked where.

```
  ask one of these (committed there in the last 30 days, this change's own authors left out): Alice (@alice)
  nobody else has committed there in the last 30 days — the count above still stands.
  who has worked there lately: not read — this is a shallow clone — it does not hold the history of those directories.
```

- The history is the **base branch's** (`git log <base> --since='30 days ago' --no-merges`), so a change
  cannot add its own; git filters on the **committer** date. The change's own authors are left out,
  because an approval has to come from someone else, and a robot (`…[bot]`) is never listed.
- **Git applies the map, and no file name is ever read back.** One query runs per `high` directory, in
  map order, carrying pathspecs that say what the map means by it: the directory, minus every listed
  directory below it — the deepest line decides, and each of those answers for itself in its own query
  (an exclude beats a later include, so they cannot share one). `./` is the files AT the root
  (`:(glob)*`, because `*` never spans `/`). Git then returns author records only. Reading a list of
  file names back was what let a quoted path, a name holding a newline, or a merge's simplified path
  list name the wrong person; there is no list to misread now.
- A person is their git **name**, plus `(@login)` only when the commit address is a platform `noreply`
  one. No e-mail address is ever printed. A name holding an `@` is replaced: by the bare login when
  there is one (`WHO carol @carol`), else by `a name that is an e-mail address` or `a name written like a
  login` — so a printed `@word` is always a real login.
- A **shallow clone** says "not read", never "nobody": it holds only the newest commits, and reading
  that as "nobody has worked here" would drop the ask instead of raising it. Wired CI checks out the
  full history (`fetch-depth: 0`, `GIT_DEPTH: 0`), so this is a local or host-overridden case.
- A side branch whose merge kept the other side still counts (`--full-history`): git otherwise simplifies
  a path-filtered log and hides it.
- **Known limit:** git's date-limited walk stops at the first commit older than the window on a chain,
  so a repo whose commit dates run out of order (a wrong clock, an imported history) can hide people
  behind that commit. It under-lists, so the printed people are always real ones.

`risk-map-check.sh --level [<base>]` prints the same result as machine lines (`BASE`, `UNKNOWN`, `NOMAP`,
`FILES`, `LEVEL`, `DIR <dir> <level> <state>`, `WHO <login|-> <name>`, `HISTNONE` — the history was read
and held nobody — and `HISTUNKNOWN <why>`) for `checks/risk-route.sh`, which joins it with the PR
body. One awk program serves both the warnings and the count. Its twin is `changeLevel` in
`cli/riskmap.mjs`, and a parity test compares the two. **Known limits:** like every check here, the
script runs from the PR's own checkout, so a PR can edit the script itself; that is harmless only because nothing
blocks on the count — the Build count stays reported, and branch protection holds the merge (E72). And, as for the warnings, a path holding a newline is
split in two here but kept whole by `changeLevel`, so the bash count can read its second half as a file
at the root; the error can only raise the count, never lower it. (The E67 history is free of that class:
it reads no file names at all.) If git itself fails, each step of the
count says "not counted"; the E65 warnings half is not guarded the same way, so a failing `git diff` or
`git ls-files` there can still end the script with git's exit code.

## CI wiring (both platforms)

The gates run identically under either CI; the config just invokes the scripts with the PR/MR base.

- **GitHub Actions** — `templates/github/yad-checks.yml` → `.github/workflows/yad-checks.yml`. The
  jobs run on `pull_request` with `fetch-depth: 0`, passing `origin/${{ github.base_ref }}` as base
  (verified-commits also gets a read-only `GH_TOKEN` for the Verified-badge lookup). The trigger sets
  `types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, edited]` — the extra `edited` so a title/body correction
  re-runs the pattern gates without a close/reopen (a plain re-run replays the frozen original payload).
  The commit-range jobs carry `if: github.event.action != 'edited'` so a bare body/title edit only
  re-runs `pr-title`/`pr-template`, not the whole suite. The pattern jobs
  read the title/body from the event payload: `pr-title` takes `${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}`
  and `pr-template` writes `${{ github.event.pull_request.body }}` to a temp file. All `--profile code`.
  The Phase 6 thread gates (`lineage-check`, `epic-open`, `reconcile-debt`) and the advisory `risk-map`
  check run as their own jobs with `fetch-depth: 0`, the same `origin/${{ github.base_ref }}` base. The build/test/lint checkout also
  uses `filter: blob:none`; its installer follows `package.json#packageManager`, and `NX_BASE` /
  `NX_HEAD` carry the exact base/head SHAs so Nx affected commands evaluate the PR rather than a
  stale default. `YAD_NODE_VERSION` is read from GitHub repository variables with `22` as the default.
  Dependencies are cached with `actions/cache` (npm's `~/.npm`, pnpm's store, and the Corepack home
  holding the pinned manager, keyed on the lockfiles and package.json) rather than setup-node's
  npm-only `cache:`, which must name the manager before package.json has been read.
- **Pinned actions, read-only token.** Every `uses:` in the GitHub templates names a commit SHA, with
  the version after it in a comment (`actions/checkout@<sha> # v4.4.0`). A tag such as `@v4` can be
  moved to other code; a SHA cannot. Each workflow also sets a top-level `permissions:` block that is
  read-only, so no job gets write access unless it asks for it. If your own Dependabot bumps a SHA in
  an installed copy that `.sdlc/managed.json` records, `yad check` then reports that file as
  `modified`, and `yad update` keeps your copy rather than overwriting it — so that file stops
  receiving template changes. (`--overwrite-local` replaces it after saving `<file>.yad-orig`; a copy
  with no record reads as `outdated`, and a plain `yad update` replaces it, saving `<file>.yad-orig`
  first.) To stay on the template, leave the pins to yadflow releases.
- **GitLab CI** — `templates/gitlab/yad-checks.gitlab-ci.yml` → `.gitlab/ci/yad-checks.yml`, pulled in
  by the root `.gitlab-ci.yml`'s `include:`. The jobs run on `merge_request_event` with `GIT_DEPTH: 0`,
  passing `origin/$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TARGET_BRANCH_NAME`; the pattern jobs read `$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TITLE`
  and `$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_DESCRIPTION`. The quality job uses the same package-manager-aware installer;
  `NX_BASE=$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_DIFF_BASE_SHA` and `NX_HEAD=$CI_COMMIT_SHA` provide the equivalent Nx
  range. Its `node:${YAD_NODE_VERSION}` image defaults to `22` and a project/group CI/CD variable may
  override it without editing the managed fragment. Those three variables sit on the `.sdlc_mr_only`
  anchor, not the fragment's top-level `variables:` — an included top-level block merges into the host
  pipeline's globals, where `NX_BASE`/`NX_HEAD` could collide with a host's own Nx setup. The retained greenfield standalone template
  (`templates/gitlab/.gitlab-ci.yml`) carries the same Node default, exact Nx range, and dependency
  installer and test-worker-cap semantics. All `--profile code`.

### Checking the Product out in CI (E120)

The four Product-reading gates can only read a Product that is on disk. Before each of them, both
workflows run `checks/product-checkout.sh` (wired into every code repo). It reads
`.sdlc/product-link.json` **from the base** — never as the PR leaves it — and, when the
`YAD_PRODUCT_TOKEN` secret is set, clones the Product's `default_branch` (depth 1; the remote's own default when the record names
none) into the record's `path`. To turn it on:

1. From the Product, run `yad check --fix --push`: it writes `.sdlc/product-link.json` into each
   connected code repo and commits it to the default branch. Set the Product's `git_url` in its
   `.sdlc/product.json` first (`yad setup` fills it from the `origin` remote). On a Product that has only
   `.sdlc/hub.json`, set it there, and never create a `product.json` beside it by hand; when both exist,
   run `yad migrate --apply --keep product` after the edit.
2. Make a token that can **read** the Product repository — on GitHub a fine-grained personal access
   token or a GitHub App token with `contents: read` on that one repo (the workflow's own `GITHUB_TOKEN`
   cannot read another private repo); on GitLab a project or group access token with `read_repository`.
3. Add it to the **code repo** as the `YAD_PRODUCT_TOKEN` secret (GitHub: Settings → Secrets and
   variables → Actions; GitLab: Settings → CI/CD → Variables, **masked**).

**Who can read the token.** The workflow runs on the PR's own copy of `checks/product-checkout.sh`, so
anyone who can push a branch to the code repo can read `YAD_PRODUCT_TOKEN` — edit the script, open a
PR. (A PR from a fork gets no secret, and defers.) So give it **read** access to the Product repository
and nothing else. On GitLab, a variable marked **protected** is not handed to pipelines of unprotected
branches, so merge requests from feature branches would defer: leave it unprotected, masked, and
read-only.

What it does in each case:

| Case | Result |
| --- | --- |
| No record on the base, no `git_url` in the record, or no `YAD_PRODUCT_TOKEN` on a PR from a fork (a fork is never given secrets) or outside CI | A note; nothing is cloned, and the gates defer as before. |
| No `YAD_PRODUCT_TOKEN` on a PR/MR that is **not** from a fork, while the base record names the Product (#345) | A `WARNING [product-checkout]` line (and a `::warning` annotation on GitHub); nothing is cloned and the gates defer — the job does not fail. On GitHub the workflow passes `YAD_PR_FORK` (head repo ≠ this repo); on GitLab the pipeline is a fork's when it runs outside the MR's target project (`CI_PROJECT_ID` ≠ `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_PROJECT_ID`) — a fork's MR pipeline a maintainer runs in the target project gets its variables, and warns. A Dependabot PR is told to add the token as a Dependabot secret too. |
| A token whose expiry the Product host reports within 30 days (#345) | A `WARNING` naming the date; the clone goes on. More than 30 days: a note with the date. |
| The host rejects the token on its API (HTTP 401) | If the clone then fails: **FAIL**, saying the token has expired or been revoked. If the clone works: a `WARNING`. |
| The record's `path` is outside the repo, `.`, absolute, or under `.git` | **FAIL** — CI can only check a second repo out inside the workspace. Change `path` in its own PR and merge that first (the record is read from the base; `yad check --fix` keeps a `path` that is set). An empty `path` is one `yad check --fix --push` from the Product writes, for each code repo cloned on that machine on its default branch. A path of only spaces fails too. |
| A folder on the way to `path` is a symlink (one the PR tracks, say) | **FAIL** — git would clone through it, to wherever it points. |
| The `path` holds files this repo tracks | **FAIL** — the gates refuse a tracked Product path anyway. Untrack the files if they do not belong in the repo (`git rm -r --cached --`, and add the folder to `.gitignore`), or change `path` in its own PR and merge that first. |
| The folder is already there | Left as it is. |
| The clone fails with a token set | **FAIL**, naming the URL and branch — a broken setup must not read like a deferral. |

The token is handed to git through its environment (`GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`, git 2.31+) as an HTTP header,
never on a command line or in a URL; on GitHub the encoded form is masked too. An `ssh` `git_url`
(`git@host:org/repo.git`) is cloned as the same repo over `https`.

**The token's expiry (#345).** Before the clone, the script makes one call to the Product host's API with
the token, handed to `curl` in a header file (`-H @file`), never on its command line, and only to the
Product's own host — or, for GitHub's cloud, its API host (`api.github.com`, `api.<sub>.ghe.com`). The API is chosen by that host first — `github.com` and `*.ghe.com` are GitHub, a host
with `gitlab` in its name is GitLab — and only for any other host by the CI it runs in. GitHub:
`rate_limit`, whose `github-authentication-token-expiration` response header carries a personal access
token's expiry. GitLab: `/api/v4/personal_access_tokens/self`, whose `expires_at` is the token's. A
token with only `read_repository` — the least it needs to clone — may not call GitLab's API at all
(HTTP 403); the note then points at `yad doctor`, which warns about the Product's **project** access
tokens that expire soon (not group or personal ones). A token with no expiry, an app token or no `curl` gives a note too, never a failure — only the clone
decides that. `yad doctor` checks where the token is SET (see
`docs/CLI.md`); it never sees the token itself.

## Sync with existing CI (merge, never clobber)

`wire` is **additive**: it brings the SDLC gates into a repo that may already have CI, without ever
editing a foreign CI file. The principle is "own a separate file; touch the foreign root only to add a
one-line include".

**GitHub.** Every workflow file runs independently, so the gates simply live in their own
`yad-checks.yml`, identified by the first-line marker `# yad-managed: yad-checks`.
- No file at our path → copy the template verbatim.
- Our marked file already there → refresh it (no-op if identical).
- A **foreign** workflow occupies the name → install as `yad-checks.gen.yml` instead and make the
  display `name:` unique. We never merge jobs into, or edit, a foreign workflow.

**GitLab.** Only one root `.gitlab-ci.yml` may exist, so the gates live in an **includable** fragment
`.gitlab/ci/yad-checks.yml` (marker `# yad-managed-include: yad-checks`). Its jobs declare `needs: []`
and **no `stage:`**, so they run in the default stage and a foreign root's `stages:` list can neither
break nor reorder them; job names are `yad-`prefixed to avoid collisions.
- No root `.gitlab-ci.yml` → write a minimal root (`gitlab-ci.include-root.yml`) that only `include:`s
  the fragment.
- Root exists → read its top-level `include:`; add the key if absent, append
  `- local: '.gitlab/ci/yad-checks.yml'` if missing, no-op if already present. **Nothing else** in the
  root is touched.
- Root YAML cannot be parsed safely → **STOP** and print the include snippet for the human to paste.

**package.json.** Only ADD a missing `lint`/`build`/`test` script; an existing one is never overwritten.

**Idempotent.** The two markers plus the include-entry check make a re-run a no-op. This is how a repo
that already had its own pipeline keeps it and still gains the gates.

## Wiring the Product (`repo: product`)

The Product is itself a repo on a platform (recorded in `.sdlc/product.json` by
`yad-connect-repos action: detect-product`). `wire repo: product` targets `{project-root}` and uses the same
merge-not-clobber logic, with a **Product-flavored gate set** appropriate to a "thinking" repo (it has no
`specs/` or `package.json` build). **What yadflow wires today** (`PRODUCT_WIRING`): `commit-message`,
`pr-title`, `pr-template` and `ledger-guard` in `yad-product-checks`, `verified-commits` in its own workflow,
and the `yad-update-guard`. On GitHub the `ledger-guard` job is given **no** `GH_TOKEN` on purpose: its
bot exemption checks the author text and the Verified badge, and the badge proves only that the
*committer* signed, so any contributor who signs could claim the bot's name. Without a token the badge
lookup fails and every bot-attributed commit that changes a ledger file is refused — safe, because the
gate-sync bot pushes only to the review PR's base (normally the default branch), never to a PR. This
holds on GitHub-hosted runners; a self-hosted runner with a stored `gh auth login` would answer the
lookup anyway. (On GitLab a project CI/CD variable reaches every job, so
the `GITLAB_TOKEN` / `SDLC_API_TOKEN` that verified-commits needs reaches ledger-guard too, and the gap is
open there.) The three below are **not shipped** — they are scripts a team
writes itself if it wants them:
- **owner-set** — every `epic.md` (and forward artifact) under `epics/EP-*/` carries an `owner`.
- **contract-locked** — where an epic has a `contract.md`, its surface hash matches
  `.sdlc/contract-lock.json` (reuse the recipe in
  `../yad-architecture/references/contract-format.md`).
- **approvals-present** — an epic at `ready-for-build` has the approvals the gate rule requires recorded
  in `.sdlc/approvals.json`: at least 1 approver (the author is not checked here — the platform's own
  rules stop self-approval on GitHub, and on GitLab when its settings say so; the same predicate
  `yad-review-gate` enforces; the risk step of the full count, capped by the active people (E72), is
  reported beside it and gates nothing).

These are advisory checks on the Product's own PRs (the Shape review PRs the verified ledger opens); they keep
the Product's artifacts internally consistent. The Product never runs the code-repo `spec-link`/`build-test-lint`
gates. Author the Product gate scripts under the Product's `checks/` following the same CI-agnostic-bash pattern.

The Product **does** run the verified-commits gate — `yad check --fix` installs `checks/verified-commits.sh`
plus a standalone workflow (`templates/github/yad-verified-commits.yml` →
`.github/workflows/yad-verified-commits.yml`, or the GitLab fragment
`templates/gitlab/yad-verified-commits.gitlab-ci.yml` → `.gitlab/ci/yad-verified-commits.yml` +
its one include line) whenever `.sdlc/product.json` has a platform with a verified ledger. So the
Shape review PRs are held to the same rule as code-repo PRs: platform-Verified signatures only.

The Product **also** runs the three pattern gates (`commit-message`, `pr-title`, `pr-template`) with
`--profile product`. The pattern gates split by the PR/MR **head branch** (passed via `--head`): a
`review/EP-*` head is a Shape review PR — Conventional-Commits commit subjects, a
`review: <artifact> (EP-<slug>)` title, and the Product artifact-review template body; **any other head is
a tooling/code change to the Product itself** and follows the `code` convention (a Conventional-Commits
title + the code task template), so a PR that changes the Product's own workflows/checks can pass.
`yad check --fix` installs the same `checks/*.sh` scripts plus a standalone Product workflow
(`templates/github/yad-product-checks.yml` → `.github/workflows/yad-product-checks.yml`, or the GitLab fragment
`templates/gitlab/yad-product-checks.gitlab-ci.yml` → `.gitlab/ci/yad-product-checks.yml` + its one include
line). Code repos run the same three with `--profile code` inside the main `yad-checks` workflow.

## The agent guardrail (`templates/hooks/ledger-guard.mjs` + `yad hook ledger-guard`)

Not a CI gate — a **harness hook**, and the only piece of yadflow that runs *inside* an agent's tool
loop. It exists because of the gap #171 reported: `checks/ledger-guard.sh` is correct and blocking,
but it speaks at CI time. An agent that hand-edits `epics/*/.sdlc/state.json` in verified mode learns
twenty minutes later, from a FAIL with nothing connecting cause to effect, and by then the write must
be reverted before the review PR/MR can go green.

**Contract** — deliberately not Claude-Code-shaped:

| | |
|---|---|
| stdin | a harness tool-call payload as JSON (optional; `--path <p>` works instead) |
| exit 0 | allow |
| exit 2 | deny — the reason is on stderr, for the agent to read |

Two harnesses match that contract, and `yad check --fix` wires both:

| Harness | File | Event | Command |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `.claude/settings.json` | `PreToolUse` | `node "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/hooks/ledger-guard.mjs"` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/hooks.json` | `preToolUse` | `node hooks/ledger-guard-cursor.mjs` |

Any other harness that can run a command and read those two exit codes can use
`node <product>/hooks/ledger-guard.mjs` by hand.

**Node scripts, not shell scripts (E113).** Every hook was a bash script until E113; each is now a
dependency-free Node script, so it runs on Windows as it does on macOS and Linux, and needs no execute
bit. Each finds the Product from its own location, never from a harness variable. On Windows, Claude
Code runs hook commands in Git Bash (PowerShell without it, where the entry does not run), and Cursor
runs them through PowerShell, which runs `node hooks/<script>.mjs` as it is. An entry naming an old
`hooks/*.sh` is rewritten by `yad check --fix`, and the old script is deleted when `.sdlc/managed.json`
proves yad wrote it unedited and no settings file still runs it.

**Cursor needs a second protocol, and this is the trap.** Its `preToolUse` is a *permission hook*:
Cursor's docs say that for a permission hook, "invalid JSON or a response that doesn't match the
hook's schema blocks the action". `ledger-guard.mjs` prints **nothing** when it allows — and empty
stdout is invalid JSON. Wiring it straight into Cursor would therefore have blocked **every** file
write in a verified project: fail-closed on everything, the opposite of this guard's whole design, and
invisible to any test that only checks that a deny denies.

So Cursor gets `hooks/ledger-guard-cursor.mjs`, installed only for a project whose targets include
`.cursor`. It calls `yad hook ledger-guard --format cursor` itself and guarantees a
permission answer on stdout, whatever happens:

| | stdout | exit |
|---|---|---|
| allow | `{"permission":"allow"}` | 0 |
| deny | `{"permission":"deny","user_message":"<reason>","agent_message":"<reason>"}` | 0 |

The field names are Cursor's documented permission-hook schema, all snake_case. Getting that wrong is
quiet in the worst way: an off-schema response still blocks, so the write is refused and any test that
checks "a deny denies" passes — while the text naming `yad gate open` is discarded and the agent is
told only "no".

The allow response is a fixed literal with nothing interpolated into it, because a malformed *allow*
is a block. The deny response carries the reason, and if that field were ever rejected as off-schema
the response is invalid — which blocks, which is what a deny wanted anyway. Both failure directions
are safe, in opposite ways, on purpose. A deny exits **0**, not 2, because the JSON is the
authoritative answer and exit 0 is what tells Cursor to read it; exit 2 blocks too but is documented
as the code for "no JSON to read", so it would discard the reason — and naming the command that owns
the transition is the entire point of speaking at edit time. The reason also goes to stderr, where
Cursor logs it.

The wrapper takes **no arguments**, and every fail-open branch (no `yad` on
PATH, an install it cannot resolve) is converted into an explicit `allow` answer rather than the
empty stdout that would block. **Exit 2 is converted into a deny**, not an allow: the wrapper
resolves `yad` from the Product's own `node_modules/yadflow` before `PATH`, so a project pinned to a
yadflow older than `--format` answers in the exit protocol — exit 2 with empty stdout — and treating
that as "no verdict" would turn a real refusal into a permitted write.

The two commands are spelled differently on purpose. Claude Code runs the string through a shell (Git
Bash on Windows), so its entry uses `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` and is quoted against a project path
containing a space. Cursor documents that a project hook runs **from the project root** but not which
shell runs the command — PowerShell on Windows — so its entry is `node` and a relative path, with no
variable and no quotes: PowerShell reads neither. Every failure mode here is silent and fails open, which would leave `yad doctor`
truthfully reporting an entry that never refuses anything.

Cursor does not document the field names inside `tool_input`, so `payloadPaths` reads any key *named*
like a path (`file_path`, `target_file`, `filePath`, `paths`) rather than guessing a vendor spelling.
It matches the key and never the value: scanning values for something shaped like a ledger path would
refuse an ordinary edit to a document that merely quotes one, and a false deny is worse than a miss in
a guard that fails open by design.

Cursor's wiring follows Cursor's published protocol and has not yet been exercised against a live
Cursor session.

**Layering.** `hooks/ledger-guard.mjs` is only the adapter: it locates `yad` (`$YAD_BIN` → the Product's
`node_modules/yadflow` → `PATH` → `npx --no-install`) and passes the payload to `yad hook
ledger-guard`, which holds the decision. So the wiring never hard-codes an install path, and the
logic is unit-tested (`cli/hook.mjs`, `cli/test.mjs`; the scripts in `cli/test-hooks.mjs`, on Windows too).

**Scope — identical to the CI gate, on purpose**, down to the details that decide the hard cases:

- Guarded: `epics/*/.sdlc/{state,approvals,comments,product-prs,hub-prs}.json` and `epics/*/reviews/*.md`.
  Exempt: `contract-lock.json` (artifact-side), `change.json`, every artifact.
- **Depth matches the gate's globs.** Its arms are bash `case` patterns, and a bash `*` spans `/`, so
  `epics/EP-a/nested/.sdlc/state.json` is guarded there — and here. Being stricter locally would let
  a path through that CI blocks.
- **The seed carve-out reads the base ref, not the working tree** (#162): the epics whose
  `state.json` the base carries are listed once with `ls-tree`, and an epic absent from that list is
  a creation. Never a `<rev>:<path>` probe — that spec resolves from the repository top level and
  `-C` does not re-anchor it, so a Product in a subdirectory of its repo would miss every time and the
  guard would allow everything, silently.
- **The base is an `origin/` ref** — `origin/<default_branch>`, then the remote's published default,
  then `origin/main`, the gate's own order. Never a bare local branch: `git fetch` does not
  fast-forward one, so a stale trunk would report a merged epic's ledger as absent and wave a real
  mutation through. If none resolves, the answer is *unknown* and unknown allows.
- **Slugs are case-folded**, as the gate folds them. On a case-insensitive filesystem `epics/ep-x/…`
  and `epics/EP-X/…` are the same file, so a byte-exact compare would let a mutation be laundered as
  a creation.
- Verified-only by the same `isVerifiedLedger` predicate the CLI and the wiring read (#186): without the
  bridge the ledger is locally owned, the hand-edit the authoring skills describe is correct, and
  nothing is wired or blocked.

**It fails OPEN, and that asymmetry is the design.** No `yad` on PATH, no Product above the edited path,
an unreadable `product.json` / `hub.json`, an unparseable payload, a `yad` that errors — every one of them ALLOWS,
with a note on stderr. A local guardrail that failed closed would brick an agent's ability to edit
anything the moment an install went sideways. The CI gate fails **closed** and is what actually
protects the ledger; this only shortens the feedback loop. `YAD_HOOK_DISABLE=1` skips one command.
The door for a PERSON is `yad commit --manual --reason "<why>"` (E49): it skips the local hook for that
one commit and records the reason as a `Ledger-Override:` trailer. `ledger-guard` in CI still FAILS the
commit — anyone can type a trailer — and prints the reason under the FAIL. Each line starts with the commit's sha, and every control character (a
carriage return, an escape) becomes a space, so an author's text never starts a line GitHub Actions would
read as a workflow command (indenting alone would not do it: the runner skips leading spaces). The author names and file paths it prints get the same cleaning (a newline in a path becomes a space too).

**Known gaps** — both fall through to the CI gate, which is why it stays the authority:

- A `Bash` tool call (`sed -i epics/…`) is not intercepted; matching it would mean parsing shell for
  write intent.
- The hook arms sessions **rooted at the Product**. A harness loads hooks from its own project root, so a
  session opened at the *workspace* (`project/`, with the Product at `project/product/`) never reads the
  Product's `.claude/settings.json` and the guard does not fire there — even though the decision itself
  resolves the Product correctly from any path. In that layout, open the session at the Product, or copy the
  entry into the workspace's own settings (the command's `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` would then need
  the Product-relative path).

**Wiring** (installed by `yad setup` / `yad check --fix`, verified Products only):

| Path | Owner |
|---|---|
| `<product>/hooks/ledger-guard.mjs` | fully managed — drift-checked and recorded in `.sdlc/managed.json` like any gate script |
| `<product>/.claude/settings.json` | **one entry**, merged additively into `hooks.PreToolUse`. See below. |

The settings file is the team's, so the rules around that one entry are deliberately conservative:

- **Ownership is an exact command match** — the current spelling or a documented past one — never a
  substring. A team keeping its own wrapper at `.claude/hooks/ledger-guard.sh` would otherwise have
  their hook silently rewritten to ours, on the `outdated` path that takes no backup. Matching
  exactly means the worst case is a second entry (the guard runs twice, harmlessly).
- **The path is quoted** (`node "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/hooks/ledger-guard.mjs"`) because the harness runs
  it through a shell: unquoted, a project path containing a space word-splits and the guard is
  silently off while `check` and `doctor` still call it wired.
- **A file that does not parse is never rewritten** — not even by `--overwrite-local`. For a managed
  file that flag restores a shipped template; here there is none, and everything in the file is the
  team's. It reports `modified` until a human fixes the JSON.
- **A `matcher` the team narrowed is left as they set it** — but `yad doctor` warns when it no longer
  selects any file-editing tool, so an installed-but-dead guard cannot pass for healthy.
- **It is never staged by `yad update --push`.** Every other path in that allowlist is a file yad
  wrote in full; this one would sweep the team's unrelated edits into a `chore` commit pushed
  straight to the default branch.
- **Both halves land together.** The script and the entry ride `yad update` as one: applying the
  entry without the script it points at would fire a missing command on every file edit.

`.claude` and `.cursor` are the only IDE targets wired (`.cursor` through its own wrapper, above): they
are the only ones with a hook protocol yadflow has read. Other targets get the script, and the contract
above is what they would wire by hand.

`yad doctor` reports the guard on a verified Product, and distinguishes the three states that matter — it
reads the same persisted `ideTargets` the wiring reads, so every gap it names is one the command it
names can actually close:

| State | Report | Remedy |
|---|---|---|
| script + entry present, matcher live | `agent ledger guard wired` | — |
| either half absent | `not wired: <what>` | `yad check --fix` |
| present but the matcher no longer selects a file-editing tool | `installed but its matcher no longer selects file edits` | restore the matcher — it is wired and never fires |
| the settings file does not parse | `cannot be wired — … does not parse` | fix the JSON by hand; yad never rewrites one it cannot parse, so nothing else clears it |

## Running by hand (Phase 3 is manual)

`yad run checks` runs every installed gate in one go, the way CI runs them: this repo's own `checks/`,
against `origin/<default branch>`, with the Product's default branch written where
`.sdlc/product-link.json` says while the four Product-reading gates run, and removed after (a folder
already there is read as it is and kept: a run removes only what it wrote). Signatures are checked with git there; the platform's
Verified badge is judged in CI. To run one gate on its own:

From inside the code repo, against the PR/MR base (e.g. `master`). For the gates that take one, the
base argument is optional — omit it and the gate resolves the trunk in the order above (configured
`default_branch`, else `origin/HEAD`, else `origin/main`), printing the base it chose; pass it (or
`export SDLC_BASE=…`) whenever the PR targets something else. `build-test-lint` takes no base at all.

```bash
bash checks/spec-link.sh                 # -> diffs the resolved trunk, and says which one
bash checks/spec-link.sh master

## Proven behavior (demo: `demo-repos/backend`, story EP-checkout-S01)

- **Good PR** (task branch with a `Task:` trailer, no surface change, passing tests) → all three **PASS**.
- **Bad PR A** (a code change committed with **no** `Task:` trailer) → spec-link **FAILS**.
- **Bad PR B** (edits `specs/.../contracts/orders.md` to widen the surface, with a `Task:` trailer
  but **no** `Contract-Change`) → spec-link passes, contract-check **FAILS** and routes back to the
  architecture gate.
