# commit-message gate.
# Every non-merge commit in the range under review must follow the project commit convention
# (CONTRIBUTING.md / config.yaml build — mirrors cli/commit.mjs buildCommitMessage):
#   - subject is "<type>: <description>" where <type> is a known Conventional-Commits type,
#   - the subject does NOT end with a period,
#   - any trailers appear in the fixed order Task -> Contract-Change -> Co-Authored-By.
# Keep the type list in sync with cli/manifest.mjs COMMIT_TYPES and config.yaml build.commit_subject_style.
#
# Profiles (--profile code|product, default code; `hub` is the old name for product): the subject rule is identical on the Product and on
# code repos (both follow CONTRIBUTING). The Task trailer is NOT required here (the spec-link gate owns
# that on code repos; Product commits are not task-scoped) — this gate only checks SHAPE and ORDER.
#
# Merge/squash commits (2+ parents) are skipped: their platform-generated subjects are not authored.

# never settled by picking one — the CLI refuses the same way (YAD-STATE-008) — so the gate FAILS and
# names both. Said on stderr and returned as a failure: this runs inside `$(...)`, where an `exit` would
# only leave the subshell. `cmp -s` is byte for byte, like the CLI's own comparison.

# whose trunk is `develop`/`master` that guess either fails closed or, where a stale `main` still
# exists, silently diffs the WRONG range (issue #161). Mirrors the CLI's own order (cli/productcommit.mjs,
# cli/repo.mjs): the CONFIGURED default_branch first, then the remote's published default
# (origin/HEAD), then origin/main. Each candidate must actually resolve before it is used, so a
# DANGLING origin/HEAD (trunk renamed, the old remote-tracking ref pruned) falls through to the next
# candidate instead of failing the gate on a fully-fetched repo. CI always passes the base explicitly,
