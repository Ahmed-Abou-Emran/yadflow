# No symlink and no submodule anywhere under specs/ (E115). The gate reads PATHS: a link lets the
# content live somewhere the paths below never name. A symlink at `specs`, `specs/<story>` or
# `specs/<story>/contracts` hid the slice from every rule here, and so did every later edit to the
# link's target; a symlinked slice file was seen once, when added, and never again. A link.md behind a
# link redirects the lock pin the fidelity check reads. yad-spec writes real files, so nothing
# legitimate lives there as a link.
#
# Read from the TREE at HEAD, not from the diff, and before the "no surface" PASS below: a link merged
# before this check existed fails every PR until one PR removes it — no diff would ever show it again.
# 120000 is a symlink, 160000 a submodule; `-r` lists `specs` itself when `specs` is the link.
#
# The WHOLE tree, from the repo root (--full-tree), matched without case: on macOS and Windows `Specs/`
# IS `specs/`, and git's path filter matches exact bytes only (`:(icase)` is refused by ls-tree). So a
# link under `Specs/` got past a `-- specs` read, and a plain file at `Specs/<story>/contracts/…` was
# never on the surface below, which is spelled in lowercase. A top folder spelled any other way than
# `specs` is refused too, once, by its own name. The name printed is everything after the first tab.
# `tolower` under LC_ALL=C folds ASCII only, so every character APFS folds (full case folding, then
# NFD) into ASCII alone is mapped by hand, as bytes — all 13, from Unicode's own tables, the same list
# as backfill-check (E121): ß and ẞ into `ss`, ſ into `s` (APFS reads `ſpecs/` as `specs/`), the Kelvin
# sign into `k`, the ligatures ﬀ ﬁ ﬂ ﬃ ﬄ ﬅ ﬆ into their letters, and the Greek question mark and varia
# into `;` and `` ` ``. That is `fold` below.
#
# The same holds one and two folders down (review 3): `specs/<story>/Contracts/` IS `contracts/` on a
# Mac, and `specs/EP-x-S01/` and `specs/ep-x-s01/` are one folder there, while every rule below reads
# exact bytes. So a `contracts` spelled any other way is refused, and so is a second spelling of a
# story folder — each once, by name. So is a FILE named `specs`, where the folder has to go. `fold`
# does not know other non-ASCII case or NFC/NFD: `EP-démo` beside `EP-DÉMO` (or an NFC/NFD twin) is not
# caught here. A twin that holds a slice fails anyway — its folder is not a story ID (E117) — and
# refusing every non-ASCII story name would refuse real repos.

# How the changed list is built, and why each flag is there (E114):

# E117. WHERE the Product is read from must not be something the PR under check chose. link.md is a file

#    about one story, so: link.md as it stands on the base when that has a value; else a sibling
#    `specs/<story>/link.md` on the base — one of the same epic first, and the first whose value reaches
#    a folder here, so one stale link.md cannot hand every new story a deferral; else — the repo's
#    first spec — this PR's value. Otherwise a PR could point it at a path that does not exist —
#    "not reachable", a deferral, a PASS — or at a folder of its own. A value that differs is printed
#    and counts once it merges. Only `product-repo` comes from the base: `contract-lock` is read as the
#    PR leaves it — a re-spec PR updates the pin, and must.
#  - a Product this repo KEEPS (a monorepo: the Product and the code in one git repo) is read as it
#    stands on the base, never as the PR leaves it. In order: (1) the path's TEXT names a folder whose
#    `.sdlc/product.json` or `hub.json` the base tracks (every Product commits one) — asked of the base before the disk,
#    which is the PR's: a PR that deleted or moved that folder read as untracked, and deferred; (2) the
#    path is walked on disk: a tracked symlink, submodule or file on the way is refused (what is behind
#    it is the PR's to choose), and so is a tracked folder that is not a kept Product, so one force-added
#    file cannot switch the gates to a partial Product; the walk is repeated from where the path really
#    lands (an alias like /proc/self/cwd means another folder to each process); an untracked folder
#    that is there is CI's checkout, and is read — unless it is inside the repo's own git folder,
#    which branch names shape (review 7); (3) only when the path reaches NOTHING, a Product the base keeps that holds
#    this story's epic is the one meant. "Inside the code repo" is NOT the test: CI can only check a
#    second repo out INSIDE the workspace, and an untracked checkout there is not the PR's.
#
# E120. Before any of that, the repo's own record: `.sdlc/product-link.json`, written by `yad check --fix`
# / `yad update` and merged on its own. Its `path` (from the repo root; where CI checks the Product out)
# is read from the BASE and wins over every link.md — so no gate takes where the Product lives from the
# PR. A record the PR adds or changes counts once it merges (a note says so). A link.md whose own
# product-repo reaches a DIFFERENT folder here gets a note; one that reaches nothing (a path on its
# author's machine) is passed over in silence. When the record's path reaches NOTHING — a developer's
# own run, where nobody cloned into it — the base's link.md order below is used if IT reaches a folder
# (still the base's, never the PR's); otherwise the record stands, and the gate defers (review 1).
