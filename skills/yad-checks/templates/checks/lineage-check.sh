# must link a real story (spec-link enforces that), and the OWNING epic must be a valid node in a
# feature thread — a change/defect/hotfix epic MUST thread to a real parent. This is the
# "every code change has an owning epic in a thread" enforcement. Per commit; maintenance commits
# (ci/chore/build/test) are exempt. Fails CLOSED on an unresolvable base.
#
# The owning epic lives in the PRODUCT repo (reached via specs/<story>/link.md's `product-repo` path,
# exactly like contract-check). When the product repo is not reachable from CI, lineage is verified
# best-effort: the commit PASSes with a note (spec-link already proved the story link).

# E117. WHERE the Product is read from must not be something the PR under check chose. link.md is a file
# the PR's own author writes, so two things are read around it:
#  - `product-repo` comes from the BASE. Where the Product lives is a fact about the whole repo, not
#    about one story, so: link.md as it stands on the base when that has a value; else a sibling
#    `specs/<story>/link.md` on the base — one of the same epic first, and the first whose value reaches
#    a folder here, so one stale link.md cannot hand every new story a deferral; else — the repo's
#    first spec — this PR's value. Otherwise a PR could point it at a path that does not exist —
#    "not reachable", a deferral, a PASS — or at a folder of its own. A value that differs is printed
#    and counts once it merges. Only `product-repo` comes from the base: `contract-lock` is read as the
#    PR leaves it — a re-spec PR updates the pin, and must.
#  - a Product this repo KEEPS (a monorepo: the Product and the code in one git repo) is read as it
#    stands on the base, never as the PR leaves it. In order: (1) the path's TEXT names a folder whose
#    `.sdlc/product.json` or `hub.json` the base tracks (every Product commits one) — asked of the base before the disk,
#    which is the PR's: a PR that deleted or moved that folder read as untracked, and deferred; (2) the
#    path is walked on disk: a tracked symlink, submodule or file on the way is refused (what is behind
#    it is the PR's to choose), and so is a tracked folder that is not a kept Product, so one force-added
#    file cannot switch the gates to a partial Product; the walk is repeated from where the path really
#    lands (an alias like /proc/self/cwd means another folder to each process); an untracked folder
#    that is there is CI's checkout, and is read — unless it is inside the repo's own git folder,
#    which branch names shape (review 7); (3) only when the path reaches NOTHING, a Product the base keeps that holds
#    this story's epic is the one meant. "Inside the code repo" is NOT the test: CI can only check a
#    second repo out INSIDE the workspace, and an untracked checkout there is not the PR's.
#
# E120. Before any of that, the repo's own record: `.sdlc/product-link.json`, written by `yad check --fix`
# / `yad update` and merged on its own. Its `path` (from the repo root; where CI checks the Product out)
# is read from the BASE and wins over every link.md — so no gate takes where the Product lives from the
# PR. A record the PR adds or changes counts once it merges (a note says so). A link.md whose own
# product-repo reaches a DIFFERENT folder here gets a note; one that reaches nothing (a path on its
# author's machine) is passed over in silence. When the record's path reaches NOTHING — a developer's
# own run, where nobody cloned into it — the base's link.md order below is used if IT reaches a folder
# (still the base's, never the PR's); otherwise the record stands, and the gate defers (review 1).
# With no record on the base, the order above is kept.
