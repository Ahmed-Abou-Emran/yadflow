# ledger-guard gate.
# In verified mode the gate ledger is CI-owned: only the yad gate-sync bot may change the
# machine-written gate-state files. A commit on a review PR by anyone else that modifies them is
# rejected — the human keeps the artifact, CI keeps the ledger. This makes "CI is the sole writer of
# the ledger" a mechanical guarantee instead of a convention.
#
# Protected (gate-state, machine-written):
#   epics/*/.sdlc/state.json, approvals.json, comments.json, product-prs.json, hub-prs.json
#   foundation/.sdlc/… and foundation/reviews/*.md — the same files for the Product level (E75), whose
#   ledger lives in its own top-level folder. A copy of this script from before that release does NOT
#   guard them; `yad doctor` says so on a verified Product that has a Foundation, and `yad update`
#   refreshes this file.
#
# BOTH names of the PR ledger are guarded. It was renamed `hub-prs.json` -> `product-prs.json`, and
# the engine writes both for one major so that a copy of THIS script which predates the rename still
# finds the file it knows. Guarding only one name would leave the other open to a hand-edit on a
# verified product — the exact thing this gate exists to refuse.
#   epics/*/reviews/*.md
#   .sdlc/index.json — the Product index (E19): derived from the ledgers above, and rebuilt by CI in the
#   same commit that records a merge. Exactly that one path: the files beside it (product.json, hub.json,
#   repos.json…) are a person's to edit, and a wider arm would refuse `yad mode` and `yad setup` commits.
#   It is never a seed, so no carve-out applies to it.
# NOT protected:
#   epics/*/.sdlc/contract-lock.json — artifact-side: the architect locks the contract surface in
#   `gate open`, so a human legitimately commits it alongside the architecture artifact.
#   A brand-new epic's ledger — CREATION is not mutation (#162). No CI path can seed one, so the
#   seed rides the first review PR/MR; see the carve-out below. Mutation stays bot-only.
#
# A "bot commit" must be BOTH authored by the gate bot (name/email contains yad-gate-sync) AND
# platform-VERIFIED. A spoofed-author commit that is not Verified is treated as a human edit and
# rejected. Known gap: the Verified badge proves only that the COMMITTER signed with their own key, not
# that the bot did, so a contributor who signs can still write the bot's name as the author. The
# GitHub workflow therefore gives this job no token: the badge lookup fails and every bot-attributed
# ledger commit is refused. On GitLab the project token reaches this job, so the gap is still open there
# (see references/check-gates.md).
#
# Scope: enforced ONLY when the ledger is verified — hub.json carries BOTH a `platform` and either
# `ledger: "verified"` or, on a project that has not run `yad migrate` yet, `bridge_enabled` (or the
# legacy `bridge`) true. That is the same predicate `isVerifiedLedger` (cli/manifest.mjs) and
# `productActions` (cli/plan.mjs) apply. With a local ledger — or a platform-less Product — humans
# legitimately write the ledger themselves, so the gate is a no-op.
#
# Degradation: a base ref that cannot be resolved FAILs closed; no platform (cannot read the Verified
# badge) WARNs and waives the signature half — the same stance verified-commits takes.

# ---- bridge gate: only CI-owned ledgers are guarded -------------------------------------------
# The predicate is BOTH a platform and the verified ledger flag, exactly as `isVerifiedLedger` (`cli/manifest.mjs`) and
# `productActions` (cli/plan.mjs) define it. Requiring the flag alone put this gate out of step with every
# other ledger reader (issue #186): a Product carrying `bridge_enabled: true` with no `platform` would
# have its human ledger commits rejected here while the CLI, reading the same file, called it
# local and kept the LOCAL write path — no CI writer and no permitted human writer, so no gate
# could advance. Reachable through a stale install (platform set, script wired, platform later
# nulled), not through `yad setup`, which derives both from one value.
#
# `tr -d '\n'` first, like every other hub.json read in these gates: a key and its value may legally
# sit on separate lines, and a per-line match would MISS the flag and silently no-op a security gate
# (the fail-open direction of issue #161).
#
# Matched at the ROOT LEVEL only. The shared `default_branch` read below is depth-blind, and that is
# survivable there — a false match yields a bogus branch name and the gate fails loudly. Here it is
# not: a nested `"bridge": true` (say under `review`) would silently ENABLE this gate on a Product whose
# `isVerifiedLedger` is false, recreating the exact no-writer deadlock #186 is about, from the other side. So
# the nesting is stripped rather than ignored: peel the outermost braces, then delete innermost
# objects/arrays until none remain, leaving only root-level pairs to match against. Not a JSON parser
# — a value containing a literal brace would confuse it — but hub.json is machine-written and the
# failure it prevents is the one that matters.
#
# Flattened ONCE into a variable and matched with here-strings, never `tr … | grep -q`: under the
# `pipefail` set above, `grep -q` exits at the first match and can SIGPIPE `tr`, which would make a
# MATCHING pipeline report failure. Reading from a here-string has no upstream process to kill.

# A platform is required either way, for the reason in the header.
#
# Step 2 is NOT dead weight. This script is committed inside the user's repo and refreshed by
# `yad update`, which is a separate act from `yad migrate` — so an un-migrated hub.json (no `ledger`
# key at all) will be read by this version of the script, and it has to keep saying "verified".
# cli/test-checks.mjs runs a table of hub.json variants through this script AND through the JS
# reader and asserts they agree on every row.

# would EXIT the script instead of recording a false — and exiting mid-guard is indistinguishable
# from passing, so the gate would silently stop guarding.
# PRESENCE of the key decides which branch runs, not whether its value is non-empty. `"ledger": ""`
# is a present key with a string value: the JS reader stops there and answers "local", so this must
# too. Testing `-n` instead sent an empty value down to the old booleans and the two readers gave

# ---- seeding carve-out: creation is not mutation (#162) ---------------------------------------
# A brand-new epic's ledger has no CI author. `gate ci` only ADVANCES an existing chain — it bails on
# a missing state.json ("the review branch is cut from the default branch, so it should carry it") and
# writes only at merge, on the default branch — and the engine itself reads a missing state.json as
# "not seeded yet". `gate open` writes nothing in verified mode, and `checkpoint` stages Build
# ledgers only. So the seed the authoring skills write (yad-epic / yad-change / yad-analysis /
# yad-discovery / yad-stub) can reach the trunk ONLY through the first review PR/MR — the one place
# this gate runs. Guarding it there makes the documented flow unshippable on a protected trunk, so an
# epic whose ledger is absent from the BASE ref is exempt: that ledger is human-authored by
# construction and the reviewer sees the whole of it in the diff. The moment its state.json is on the
# base ref the guard is absolute again.
#
# Anchored on state.json — the ledger root, the same "is this epic seeded?" question the engine asks —
# NOT on the individual file: adding hub-prs.json to an epic that IS on the base ref still FAILs.
# Anchored on the BASE ref, not the parent commit, so delete-then-re-add cannot reset the exemption
# (the deletion is itself a guarded change).
#
# The slug match is CASE-FOLDED on purpose. Git paths are byte-exact, but macOS/Windows checkouts are
# not: seeding `epics/ep-x/.sdlc/state.json` beside an on-base `epics/EP-X/` would probe as a brand-new
# epic, pass, and then land ON TOP of the real ledger in every case-insensitive clone — a mutation
# laundered as a creation. So the base's seeded slugs are read once (one ls-tree, not one probe per
# path) and compared folded.
#
# Slugs are held in ARRAYS read from NUL-delimited git output, never in a space- or newline-delimited
# string: git permits a newline inside a path, and a `EP-<newline>x` slug split across two records
# would drop the real epic out of the on-base list and let a mutation through as a "creation". Both
# arrays carry one empty sentinel element so `"${a[@]}"` is safe under `set -u` on bash 3.2 (macOS),
