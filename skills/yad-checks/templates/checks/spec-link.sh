# spec-link gate (Phase 3 build plan §C).
# Every NON-MAINTENANCE commit must link a real story/spec: it must carry a
# `Task: <story>-<task>` trailer whose <story> resolves to a specs/<story>/link.md.
# Maintenance commits (ci/chore/build/test) are EXEMPT — CI wiring, dependency bumps,
# and test-infra changes legitimately link no story. The exemption covers the ABSENCE of
# a link, never a BROKEN one: a maintenance commit that carries a Task trailer is still
# resolved, so `chore: x` + `Task: EP-ghost-S01-T01` fails exactly like any other commit
# claiming a story that does not exist. Checked per commit (not aggregated across the
# range), so the report names every offending commit.

# `.sdlc/hub.json`, which an older yadflow wrote and its gates read. The environment may name the file
# instead: SDLC_PRODUCT_CONFIG, or the older SDLC_HUB_CONFIG. Two names that say different things are
# never settled by picking one — the CLI refuses the same way (YAD-STATE-008) — so the gate FAILS and
# names both. Said on stderr and returned as a failure: this runs inside `$(...)`, where an `exit` would
# only leave the subshell. `cmp -s` is byte for byte, like the CLI's own comparison.

# whose trunk is `develop`/`master` that guess either fails closed or, where a stale `main` still
# exists, silently diffs the WRONG range (issue #161). Mirrors the CLI's own order (cli/productcommit.mjs,
# cli/repo.mjs): the CONFIGURED default_branch first, then the remote's published default
# (origin/HEAD), then origin/main. Each candidate must actually resolve before it is used, so a
# DANGLING origin/HEAD (trunk renamed, the old remote-tracking ref pruned) falls through to the next
# candidate instead of failing the gate on a fully-fetched repo. CI always passes the base explicitly,
