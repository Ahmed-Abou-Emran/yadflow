// member-check gate (E131) — a member file (`.sdlc/members/<platform>-<login>.json`) says which accounts and
// which git emails are one person. The active-people count joins a commit to an approval through it, so a
// false file would fold one person into another and make the count SMALLER. This gate refuses that:
//
//   1. A PR may ADD or CHANGE only its author's own file: named `<platform>-<author>.json`, holding exactly
//      one account on the Product's platform and host — the author's, with the author's numeric account id
//      (so a login someone renamed away from, and another person registered, cannot take over the old file).
//      Never a bot's.
//   2. On GitHub, every email in a file the PR adds or changes must be the author email of a commit in the PR that GitHub itself
//      attributes to the PR's author (`commits/<sha>` → `author.login`). GitHub links a commit to an account
//      only through an email that account has verified, so this is the platform's proof, not the file's
//      claim. `yad member add` writes one commit per email for exactly this. On GitLab the API says no such
//      thing, so emails there feed the team list only and are never used by the gate count (the user's
//      decision, 2026-10-05) — this gate checks the owner rule alone.
//   3. A PR may DELETE anyone's file (removing a person can only make the count larger). `yad member remove
//      <login> --reason` puts the reason in the commit.
//   4. No account on the Product's platform, and no email, may be in two member files. (An OTHER account
//      two files claim is not refused: the CLI matches it to nobody until one file drops it, and refusing
//      it here would let whoever claimed it first block its real owner from joining.)
//   5. `.sdlc` and `.sdlc/members` are real folders and nothing under them is a link, and no path is a
//      case or Unicode twin of `.sdlc/members/` — a macOS or Windows checkout would read either as a member
//      file this gate never judged (E131 review 1–2; the E115 and E121 lessons).
//
// LIMIT: like every Product gate, this file and the workflow that runs it come from the PR's own checkout,
// so a PR can change the gate it is judged by; branch protection on the default branch is the backstop.
//
// A Node script, not bash: it reads JSON and hashes, and both CI images already have Node (E113's hooks are
// Node for the same reason). Usage: node checks/member-check.mjs <base-ref>
//   GitHub: PR_AUTHOR and PR_AUTHOR_ID (github.event.pull_request.user.login / .id) and GH_TOKEN (a read
//   token) in the environment.
//   GitLab: CI_API_V4_URL, CI_PROJECT_ID, CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID, and GITLAB_TOKEN or SDLC_API_TOKEN. With no
//   token it FAILS when a member file changed (fail closed — the user's decision, 2026-10-05).
