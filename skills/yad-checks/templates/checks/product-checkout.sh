# Check the Product out where the code repo's record says (E120), so the Product-reading gates
# (contract-check, lineage-check, epic-open, reconcile-debt-check) can read it in CI.
#
# The record is `.sdlc/product-link.json` — `git_url`, `path` (from the repo root, inside the repo) and
# `default_branch` — written by `yad check --fix` / `yad update` and merged on its own. It is read from

# Needs the YAD_PRODUCT_TOKEN secret (a token that can read the Product: a GitHub fine-grained token or
# App token, a GitLab project/group access token). Without it nothing is cloned and the gates defer. A PR
# from a fork never gets a secret, so there that is a note; on any other PR in CI the record says the team
# wants the Product read, so a missing token is a loud WARNING (#345) — still not a failure. With a token,
# a clone that fails FAILS the job: a broken setup must not read like a deferral. Before the clone, one
# call to the Product host's API with the token reads its expiry date, so CI warns 30 days before the
# token stops working and says "rejected" when the platform refuses it (#345).
