# SDLC — Check Gates (Build Step C)

**Goal:** Install and run the **check gates** that protect production for a code repo. They run
in CI on every PR/MR and must pass before merge (build plan §C). Each is a small, separate check:

1. **spec-link** — the change links a real story/spec: its commits carry a `Task: <story>-<task>`
   trailer (the convention `yad-implement` writes) whose `<story>` resolves to `specs/<story>/link.md`.
   No unlinked code reaches merge.
2. **contract-check** — if the diff changes the **contract surface** (the repo's quoted slice under
   `specs/<story>/contracts/`) without a `Contract-Change: yes` trailer **and** an updated, re-locked
   contract upstream, it **FAILS and routes back to the architecture gate**. The shared surface is
   never widened from inside a code repo (Phase 2 contract representation: delimited block + SHA-256 lock).
   **A quote is not a change (issue #344):** a slice whose every changed file is Markdown holding exactly
   one `<!-- CONTRACT-QUOTE:BEGIN -->` … `<!-- CONTRACT-QUOTE:END -->` block (plus blank lines and, first,
   the optional title `# Contract slice — <story ID>`), the block an unbroken, in-order run of the locked
   `CONTRACT-SURFACE` lines, passes with **no** trailer — when the Product is reached, `link.md` pins the current lock, and the locked `contract.md`
   (the owner's, for a change-epic's pointer lock) still hashes to it. Anything it cannot prove still
   needs the trailer. **The change is what merging the branch into the target would change** (issue
   #363; `git merge-tree`, git 2.38+), so a slice that changed on the target after the branch split off is
   not this branch's, and a rename on the target cannot carry an edit into a slice unseen. A branch that
   does not merge cleanly fails closed; an older git reads from the merge base and fails closed on
   several merge bases or a file the target removed or moved that the branch modifies. A slice the
   branch's own commits touch counts even when the merge nets it to nothing (a "Rebase and merge"
   replays every commit); `docs/branch-protection.md` lists the merge methods the gate models.
   Every story whose slice the diff touches is checked, not just the first — see `references/check-gates.md`.
   A claimed `Contract-Change` against an epic that has **no lock at all** fails too: an epic on a short
   lane (`chore`/`spike`) has no architecture step and never locks a surface, so it may consume the
   contract but not change it, and the change belongs to a new epic on `classic`. That failure needs the
   epic's ledger directory to resolve — a Product that is simply not checked out still defers, as before,
   except on a repo's **first spec** (no `link.md` on the base names a Product): there a slice change whose
   `product-repo` reaches nothing **fails** (E119), because the PR chose that value itself. Where the
   Product lives is a repo fact once `yad check --fix --push` has merged `.sdlc/product-link.json` into
   the code repo (E120): the gates read it from the base first, and `checks/product-checkout.sh` clones
   the Product there in CI when the `YAD_PRODUCT_TOKEN` secret is set (see `references/check-gates.md`).
3. **build/test/lint** — standard quality stage; tests must actually exercise new behavior, not just pass.
   CI installs and runs through the package manager declared by the repo's standard
   `package.json#packageManager` field (`npm` and `pnpm` are supported; any other manager stays on
   npm with a warning when an npm lockfile is present, and fails closed otherwise); an npm repo
   without that field retains the historical npm behavior. A declared manager requires a full, exact semantic
   version (with Corepack's optional integrity suffix supported), and CI activates that exact version.
   The code-repo `yad-checks` workflow uses Node 22 by default (the build/test/lint job on GitHub; every
   `yad-*` gate job's image in the GitLab fragment) and reads `YAD_NODE_VERSION` (a GitHub repository
   variable or GitLab CI/CD variable) for repos whose declared runtime differs (a declared `packageManager` needs Corepack, so the override must be a line that
   bundles a current one: 20.19+, 22.14+ or 24; Node 25+ dropped it). The Product-side workflows (verified-commits, product-checks, update-guard,
   gate-sync) only run the `yad` CLI and keep their own pinned Node; the variable does not reach them.
   The CI job sets `YAD_TEST_MAX_WORKERS` (default `2`); the gate caps jest/vitest test concurrency at
   that and is a no-op for other runners (see `references/check-gates.md`).
4. **verified-commits** — no unsigned commits: every commit in the range must carry a signature the
   platform marks **Verified**. There is no author allowlist (E62): write access to the repo decides who
   can author. An old `.sdlc/verified-authors` file is no longer read, and the gate prints a note when it
   finds one. Enforced on the **Product and every connected repo**; runs on PRs/MRs only, so the
   gate-sync bot's direct ledger pushes are unaffected (never replace it with a default-branch push rule — see
   `references/check-gates.md` §4).
5. **lineage-check** (Phase 6) — the change's owning epic is a valid node in a **feature thread**: a
   `change`/`defect`/`hotfix` epic must thread to a real `parent`. Builds on spec-link's story→epic
   resolution; the every-code-change-has-a-threaded-epic enforcement.
6. **epic-open** (Phase 6, the staleness preventer) — an epic is **sealed** once every story is
   `shipped`; a commit targeting a sealed epic **FAILS**, forcing new behaviour into a new threaded
   change-epic (so the Shape artifacts can never go stale).
7. **reconcile-debt** (Phase 6) — a hotfix that shipped first opens debt; the **next** change on its
   thread **FAILS** until the debt is paid (artifacts updated + a regression test added).
8. **risk-map** (E65, **advisory — never fails**) — reads the code repo's `.sdlc/risk-map` (one line per
   directory: `high` / `medium` / `low`, no names) and **warns** when this change adds a directory no line
   covers, leaves a line whose directory is gone, touches a line still `unset` or `guessed`, or edits the
   map itself. A repo with no map gets one note. It also prints the **approver count** (E66): a change
   touching a directory the **base branch's** map marks `high` asks for one more approver — reported,
   never enforced: branch protection holds the merge — and names who has **committed there in the last 30 days**
   (E67), so the team knows who can meet that ask. The map is the team's file, never wired; the
   `yad-connect-repos` skill drafts it. See `references/check-gates.md` §10.

The Phase 6 gates read the owning epic in the **Product** via `specs/<story>/link.md`'s
`product-repo` path (like contract-check), and degrade to a PASS-with-note when the Product is not reachable
from CI. `product-repo` is read from the base, a Product this repo tracks is read from the base commit, and
`epic:` must be the story ID's prefix — the PR cannot choose what is gated (E117, E118). See `references/check-gates.md` and `skills/yad-change`.

The gates are **CI-agnostic bash** in `checks/`; thin pipeline configs invoke them on GitHub Actions
and GitLab CI. This step is **by hand** in Phase 3 — run the gates with the skill or let CI run them;
**nothing auto-advances**. The gates are blocking in CI (all but the advisory risk-map check), but the human still owns the merge (Step E).

## Conventions

- `{project-root}` resolves from the project working directory — the **product** repo (holds the
  canonical templates under this skill).
- Code repos are separate git repos under `{project-root}/demo-repos/<repo>/`
  (`config.yaml` `build.code_repos_root`).
- Canonical gate sources live in this skill's `templates/` (the source of truth that gets installed
  into each code repo):
  - `templates/checks/{spec-link,contract-check,package-manager,install-deps,build-test-lint,verified-commits,risk-map-check}.sh`
  - `templates/checks/ledger-guard.sh` → **Product-only** gate, active **only in verified mode** — `product.json`
    (`hub.json` on an older Product) carries BOTH a `platform` and `ledger: "verified"` — or, before `yad migrate`, `bridge_enabled`
    (or the legacy `bridge`) true. The same predicate
    `isVerifiedLedger` (`cli/manifest.mjs`) applies, so the gate and the CLI can never disagree about who owns the
    ledger (#186). A no-op otherwise, when humans legitimately own it. On review PRs it FAILs any
    commit that touches the
    CI-owned gate ledger (`.sdlc/{state,approvals,comments,product-prs,hub-prs}.json`, `reviews/*.md`) unless it
    is a **verified gate-bot commit** — bot-authored AND platform-Verified. (Known gap: the Verified
    badge proves only that the committer signed, not that the bot did, so the GitHub job is given no
    token and refuses every such commit; on GitLab the gap is still open. See `references/check-gates.md`.) `.sdlc/contract-lock.json` is artifact-side and exempt. So is a **new epic's seed**:
    no CI path can create a ledger (`gate ci` only *advances* an existing chain, at merge, on the
    default branch), so an epic whose `.sdlc/state.json` is absent from the base ref may be created by
    a human on its first review PR/MR — **creation, not mutation** (#162). Once the ledger is on the
    default branch the guard is absolute again. Runs in `yad-product-checks`; `verified-commits` runs beside
    it in its own `yad-verified-commits` workflow (and requires the bot's signature like any other
    commit's). See `yad-product-bridge`.
  - `templates/hooks/ledger-guard.mjs` → **Product-only** agent guardrail, active **only in verified mode**
    (the same `isVerifiedLedger` predicate). Not a CI gate: it is a **harness hook** that refuses an agent's
    edit to the CI-owned ledger at the moment it is attempted and names `yad gate open` instead — the
    local half of `checks/ledger-guard.sh` (#171). Installed to `<product>/hooks/ledger-guard.mjs` with the
    `PreToolUse` entry in `.claude/settings.json`; a `.cursor` project also gets
    `templates/hooks/ledger-guard-cursor.mjs` and a `preToolUse` entry in `.cursor/hooks.json`.
    Fails OPEN; see "Step 2b" below. Every hook is a Node script the entry runs as `node <script>`, so
    it needs no bash and no execute bit and runs on Windows too (E113).
  - `templates/hooks/yad-capture.mjs` → **Product-only**, in **both** ledger modes (E43): the post-edit
    harness hook that runs `yad capture --hook`, which snapshots every changed Shape artifact onto the
    person's private `yad/wip/<name>/<epic>` branches without touching the checkout. Wired as a
    `PostToolUse` entry in `.claude/settings.json` and an `afterFileEdit` entry in `.cursor/hooks.json`;
    always exits 0. It prints nothing, except under Claude Code when a file the edit changed is also
    being edited by someone else (E46 claims): then one PostToolUse JSON note the agent reads.
    `"capture": false` in the Product config unwires it.
  - `templates/github/yad-verified-commits.yml` + `templates/gitlab/yad-verified-commits.gitlab-ci.yml`
    → the standalone Product-side verified-commits CI (installed by `yad check --fix` with the Product wiring)
  - `templates/github/yad-checks.yml` → installs to `.github/workflows/yad-checks.yml` (marked `# yad-managed: yad-checks`);
    its quality job uses `install-deps.sh`, reads the optional `YAD_NODE_VERSION` repository variable,
    exports the PR's exact `NX_BASE`/`NX_HEAD`, and filters unrelated history blobs while preserving
    the full commit graph.
  - `templates/gitlab/yad-checks.gitlab-ci.yml` → includable fragment, installs to `.gitlab/ci/yad-checks.yml`;
    it uses the same installer, honors a project/group `YAD_NODE_VERSION` CI/CD variable, and exports
    the MR's exact `NX_BASE`/`NX_HEAD`.
  - `templates/gitlab/gitlab-ci.include-root.yml` → minimal root written only when no root `.gitlab-ci.yml` exists
  - `templates/gitlab/.gitlab-ci.yml` → legacy standalone root (greenfield single-file option), kept
    semantically aligned with the includable fragment's Node version, Nx range, dependency install,
    and test-worker cap
- The gates depend on the conventions from earlier steps: the `Task:`/`Contract-Change:` commit
  trailers (`yad-implement`), the `specs/<story>/link.md` + `contracts/` slice (`yad-spec`), and the
  locked `contract.md` (`yad-architecture`).

## Inputs

- `repo`  — the code repo to wire/run gates for (one of an epic's repos), or `product` to wire the Product itself (`hub`, the old name, still works). A code repo that is itself named
  `product`: give its registered path instead (for example `repos/product`), so it is not taken for the Product.
- `action` — `wire` (install the gates into the repo) | `run` (run the three gates now). Default `run`.
- `base`  — for `run`: the base ref to diff against (the PR/MR target; default the repo's default branch).

## On Activation

### Step 1 — Resolve the code repo
Map `repo` → `{project-root}/demo-repos/<repo>/` (or the registry `path` in `.sdlc/repos.json`). A `repo` value with a `/` in it is a registry `path`, not a name: match it against each entry's `path`
(so a code repo named `product` is reached as, for example, `repos/product`). Confirm
it is its own git repo. Operate inside it with absolute paths. For `repo: product`, the target is
`{project-root}` itself and the platform comes from `.sdlc/product.json` (`.sdlc/hub.json` on an older Product) — see "Wiring the Product" in
`references/check-gates.md`.

### Step 2 — `wire` (install the gates, syncing with any existing CI)
Copy from this skill's `templates/`:
- `templates/checks/*.sh` → `<repo>/checks/` (and `chmod +x`).
- Detect the platform and **merge — never clobber — the matching** CI config. Inspect what is already
  there first; the principle is **additive: never edit a foreign CI file**.

  **GitHub** (detect by any `.github/workflows/*.y*ml`): our gates live in their own
  `.github/workflows/yad-checks.yml`, which GitHub runs independently of every other workflow, so
  "merge" reduces to "do not collide on the path".
  - No file at our path → copy `templates/github/yad-checks.yml` verbatim.
  - A file at our path whose **first line is `# yad-managed: yad-checks`** → it is ours; refresh it
    (no-op if unchanged). 
  - A **foreign** file occupies that path/name → write to a non-colliding filename
    (`yad-checks.gen.yml`) and ensure its `name:` does not clash. Never merge jobs into a foreign
    workflow; never edit one.
  - Also install `templates/github/yad-update-guard.yml` → `.github/workflows/yad-update-guard.yml`
    (marker `# yad-managed: yad-checks`) — the push-on-default integrity gate for direct-to-default
    commits (`yad update --push`); it runs only `verified-commits` + `commit-message`. Same
    own-a-file rules as above.

  **GitLab** (detect by a root `.gitlab-ci.yml` and/or `.gitlab/ci/*.yml`): install the includable
  fragment `templates/gitlab/yad-checks.gitlab-ci.yml` → `<repo>/.gitlab/ci/yad-checks.yml` (its jobs
  carry `needs: []` and no `stage:`, so a foreign root `stages:` cannot break or reorder them).
  - No root `.gitlab-ci.yml` → write `templates/gitlab/gitlab-ci.include-root.yml` to
    `<repo>/.gitlab-ci.yml` (a minimal root that only `include:`s our fragment).
  - Root exists → read its top-level `include:`. Add the `include:` key if absent; append
    `- local: '.gitlab/ci/yad-checks.yml'` if the key exists but the entry is missing; **no-op** if it
    is already listed. Touch nothing else in the root.
  - Also install `templates/gitlab/yad-update-guard.gitlab-ci.yml` → `<repo>/.gitlab/ci/yad-update-guard.yml`
    (marker `# yad-managed-include: yad-checks`) — the push-on-default integrity gate — and append
    `- local: '.gitlab/ci/yad-update-guard.yml'` to the root `include:` the same additive, idempotent way.
  - If the existing YAML cannot be parsed safely → **STOP** and print the exact include snippet for the
    human to paste (graceful degradation — never guess-edit a pipeline you cannot parse).
  - The legacy standalone `templates/gitlab/.gitlab-ci.yml` is retained only for a clean greenfield repo
    that prefers a single self-contained file; the include path above is the default.
  - **Tag-locked runners** (`run_untagged: false`, common on self-hosted): the fragment's jobs run a
    docker image, so set a `YAD_RUNNER_TAGS` CI/CD variable (e.g. `dind_runner`) to route them — the
    `default:` block emits `tags: [$YAD_RUNNER_TAGS]`. When unset, current GitLab (≥15) drops the
    empty-expanded tag so the jobs run untagged (gitlab.com shared runners); older versions may
    strand them `pending`, in which case set the variable to a real tag. The variable lives in
    project settings, so it survives every `yad` sync. Single value only — `tags: [$VAR]` is one tag
    equal to the whole variable, not a comma-split.

- Ensure `<repo>/package.json` defines `lint`, `build`, `test` scripts (see `references/check-gates.md`
  for the canonical scripts). **Only ADD a missing script; never overwrite an existing one.**

Re-running `wire` is **idempotent** — markers (`# yad-managed: yad-checks`,
`# yad-managed-include: yad-checks`) and the include-entry check make a second run a no-op.
Commit the wiring on the repo's default branch (it is shared infrastructure, not a task diff).

**The Product is wired the same way.** `repo: product` wires the Product repo itself (platform from `.sdlc/product.json`)
with a Product-flavored gate set — see "Wiring the Product" in `references/check-gates.md`.

**The Product also gets the agent guardrail** (see below): `templates/hooks/ledger-guard.mjs` →
`<product>/hooks/ledger-guard.mjs`, plus the `PreToolUse` entry in `.claude/settings.json`. A project
whose targets include `.cursor` also gets `templates/hooks/ledger-guard-cursor.mjs` and a `preToolUse`
entry in `.cursor/hooks.json`. `yad setup` and `yad check --fix` install them; nothing by hand.

### Step 2b — the agent guardrail (harness hooks, verified mode only)
The CI gates speak at CI time. That is too late for one failure the field kept hitting (#171): in
verified mode the gate ledger is **CI-owned**, so an agent that hand-edits
`epics/*/.sdlc/state.json` only finds out twenty minutes later, from a `ledger-guard` FAIL with
nothing connecting cause to effect — and by then the write has to be reverted before the review
PR/MR can go green.

`hooks/ledger-guard.mjs` is the local half of that same rule. It runs as a **harness hook** before a
file-editing tool call and refuses the write up front, naming the command that owns the transition
(`yad gate open`), so the agent corrects itself instead of failing a pipeline.

- **Harness-agnostic by contract.** The script only locates `yad` and hands the tool payload to
  `yad hook ledger-guard`: **stdin** is a JSON tool-call payload, **exit 0** allows, **exit 2**
  denies with the reason on stderr. Claude Code's `PreToolUse` reads exactly that, so its entry points
  straight at the script. Cursor does NOT: its `preToolUse` is a **permission hook**, which wants a
  JSON verdict on stdout and treats an empty or off-schema answer as a refusal — and this script
  prints nothing when it allows, so wiring it there directly would block every file write in the
  project. Cursor's entry runs `node hooks/ledger-guard-cursor.mjs` instead, which runs
  `yad hook ledger-guard --format cursor` and always answers `{"permission":"allow"}` or
  `{"permission":"deny","user_message":…,"agent_message":…}`. **Check which kind a harness is
  before wiring it by hand.** A hook that fires only AFTER the write, such as Cursor's
  `afterFileEdit`, is not used: it could report the edit but never refuse it, and reporting is what
  the CI gate already does.
- **Targets with no such hook are named, not skipped.** `.agents`, `.gemini`, `.zencoder` and
  `.opencode` get the script and no wiring, and `yad doctor` says which of a project's targets are
  guarded by CI alone. Silence about an unguarded target reads as a guarded one.
- **Same scope as the CI gate**, deliberately: guarded are `epics/*/.sdlc/{state,approvals,comments,product-prs,hub-prs}.json`
  and `epics/*/reviews/*.md` (at the gate's own glob depth, which spans `/`); exempt are
  `contract-lock.json`, `change.json`, and every artifact. A **new** epic's ledger is exempt too —
  creation, not mutation (#162), decided by listing the epics the **base ref** carries (an
  `origin/` ref, case-folded slugs), never by looking at the working tree.
- **A no-op with a local ledger.** There the ledger is locally owned and the hand-edit the authoring
  skills describe is *correct*, so nothing is wired and nothing is blocked.
- **It fails OPEN** — no `yad`, no Product, an unreadable config, an unparseable payload all ALLOW, with
  a note on stderr. `ledger-guard` in CI fails *closed* and remains the authority. `YAD_HOOK_DISABLE=1`
  skips one command. A PERSON who must commit a ledger change anyway uses `yad commit --manual --reason
  "<why>"` (E49) — never the agent on its own initiative.
- **Known gaps** (both caught by the CI gate instead): a `Bash` tool call (`sed -i epics/…`) is not
  intercepted — matching it would mean parsing shell; and the hook arms sessions **rooted at the
  Product**, since a harness reads hooks from its own project root — a session opened at the workspace
  above the Product never loads the Product's `.claude/settings.json`.

`yad doctor` reports the guardrail as `agent ledger guard wired` / `not wired` on a verified Product.
See `references/check-gates.md` §"The agent guardrail".

**The same rule for a person's `git commit` (E48).** On a verified Product, `yad check --fix` also
installs `.git/hooks/pre-commit` in the clone it runs in. It runs `node hooks/ledger-guard.mjs
--staged`, which judges the files the commit is about to record by the same rules as the CI gate (a
merge commit and a `yad-gate-sync` commit pass, as they do in CI) and refuses the commit with the files,
the `git restore --staged` line and the owning command. It is per clone — git never copies hooks — so
`yad doctor` warns `git-hook` in a clone that has none. A `pre-commit` that is not yad's, or a
`core.hooksPath` folder, is never written: print the one line `yad doctor` gives and let the person add
it. Branch protection is what makes the CI gates hold a merge at all: point the team at yadflow's
`docs/branch-protection.md`.

### Step 3 — `run` (run the gates now)
From inside the repo, run each gate against `base` and report PASS/FAIL per gate:
```
bash checks/spec-link.sh "<base>"
bash checks/contract-check.sh "<base>"
bash checks/build-test-lint.sh
```
`<base>` is optional for the gates that take one (`build-test-lint` takes none) — omitted, the gate
resolves the trunk (configured `default_branch`, else `origin/HEAD`, else `origin/main`) and prints
the base it chose; pass it (or `SDLC_BASE`) when the PR/MR targets another branch.

A non-zero exit is a FAIL. Summarize which gates passed and, for any failure, the exact remediation
(spec-link: add the `Task:` trailer / spec; contract-check: route back to the architecture gate and
re-lock the contract; build/test/lint: fix the failing lint/test).

### Step 4 — Report; the advance decision belongs to the dial (Phase 4)
Report the gate results. Passing gates do **not** merge anything — the AI review (Step D/E) and the
human engineer review (Step E) still own the merge. This skill never edits the epic's `.sdlc/` state.

- **Run standalone** (the Phase 3 default): **stop** here. A clean pass does not advance anything; a
  human takes the next step.
- **Run by the orchestrator** (`yad-run`, Phase 4): this skill still just reports PASS/FAIL — the
  *advance decision* is the orchestrator's, read from the `checks` step's advance dial. On a clean
  pass with `checks` set to `advance: auto`, `yad-run` advances to `engineer-review` on its own;
  on any FAIL it halts and pulls in a human (build plan §B). **What the gates check is unchanged** —
  only who decides to proceed after a clean pass.

## Hard rules (build plan §C, Cross-cutting)

- **The gates are blocking in CI, advisory to no one.** A FAIL stops the merge; a PASS does not grant it.
- **Contract surface is never widened from a code repo.** contract-check routes surface changes back
  to the architecture gate; only an updated, re-locked contract + `Contract-Change: yes` may pass.
- **Tests must exercise behavior.** build/test/lint is not satisfied by empty or trivial tests.
- **The gate never advances itself.** A FAIL always halts. A clean PASS advances only when the
  orchestrator's `checks` dial is `advance: auto` (`yad dial`) — and only as far as the engineer review,
  which is always human. Standalone, the gate still stops and the human owns the merge.
