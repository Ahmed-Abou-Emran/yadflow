# SDLC — Author Spec (Build Step A)

**Goal:** Turn ONE `ready-for-build` story into a per-repo Spec Kit spec/plan/tasks inside that
story's code repo. The heavy spec ceremony runs **once per story per repo**; the light
tasks → implement loop is **Step B** (`yad-implement`). This step **never re-locks the contract** —
the cross-repo surface is owned upstream by the architecture gate (build plan §A, Cross-cutting
"Heavy spec once per story, light loop per task"). It does not advance the Shape state machine;
when driven by the orchestrator (`yad-run`, Phase 4) it records a `spec`/`tasks` trust signal
(Step 8) — but it never auto-advances a contract change or a Shape step.

Spec Kit is driven as **harness slash-commands** (`/speckit.*`), not a subprocess CLI (Phase 0
Deviation 3). When Spec Kit is not used (**When a tool is missing** below), the same files are
hand-authored in Spec Kit's exact layout and the spec is marked `speckit: not-installed` — the workflow
does not block on the tool. This
is the same graceful-degradation pattern `yad-ui` uses for Impeccable.

## When a tool is missing

<!-- Written from yadflow's cli/toolbox.mjs (E87). Change the words there: a test holds this section to it. -->

No tool below is required. When one is missing, this skill still finishes, using the fallback written
beside it.

For Spec Kit, decide from yad's answer, not from a guess:
run `yad toolbox list --json` and read, in its `tools` list, the entry with the tool's `id`. Run it
where the tool will run: for work inside a code repo, add `--dir <that repo>`, so the tools installed
there are found.

- **The team's choices.** They come from the Product. If the answer's `product` is null, yad found no
  Product, so a tool the team chose not to use still shows `used: true`. Tell the person that.
- **When yad cannot see the tool.** yad does not read every way a tool can be set up (an older install
  may be missed). If the entry says `missing` but the check in the steps below finds the tool, use
  it — but never when the entry says `used: false`.
- **When yad cannot answer** (yad is not installed here, or the command fails), use the check in the
  steps below.

Tell the person which tools you used and which fallbacks, and why.

- **Spec Kit** (`spec-kit`). Use it when its entry has `used: true` and `status.state` is `installed` or `available`. Otherwise — not found, its plugin turned off in Claude Code, or the team chose not to use it (`yad toolbox remove spec-kit`) — use the fallback.
  - Fallback — yad-spec writes the same spec files by hand, in Spec Kit's layout.
  - Record `speckit: not-installed`. It means the tool was not used, whatever the reason — except a light spec, which never runs Spec Kit and records `speckit: not-used` (#348).

<!-- end: When a tool is missing -->

## Conventions

- `{project-root}` resolves from the project working directory — the **product** repo (epic
  "thinking" + per-epic `.sdlc/` state live here).
- **Code repos are separate git repos**, one `.git` each, under `{project-root}/demo-repos/<repo>/`
  (`config.yaml` `build.code_repos_root`). All Spec Kit outputs land **inside the code repo**, never
  in the product repo.
- `{feature-id}` is the **story ID** (e.g. `EP-checkout-S01`) — **pinned**, never Spec Kit's
  numbered auto-slug (which is unstable and severs the permanent story link). The spec folder is
  `specs/<story-id>/`.
- Spec Kit output layout (RESEARCH-NOTES §2): `specs/<feature-id>/spec.md` (+ `research.md`,
  `data-model.md`, `contracts/`), `plan.md`, `tasks.md`; constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.
- Speak in the `communication_language` set in `{project-root}/.sdlc/config.yaml`; write documents in `document_output_language`.

## Inputs

- `epic`  — the `EP-<slug>` to operate on (ask if not provided).
- `story` — the ONE story to spec, `EP-<slug>-S0N` (ask if not provided).
- `repo`  — one entry from that story's `repos` (the ONE repo to spec; ask if the story lists more
  than one).

## Ask the human-only questions first, in one batch

<!-- The same section is in yad-spec and yad-implement: a test holds the two copies equal (#357). -->

Some decisions belong to the human alone. If one turns up late, the long work stops and waits for it.
So before the long work starts, list every such decision together with every open question, and ask
them all in **one** message.

**Human-only decisions** — never decide these yourself, and never pick a default just to keep going:
- **Security trade-offs.** Who may call or see what, what data is stored, logged or shown, how
  people sign in, and any check made weaker on purpose.
- **Secrets and tokens.** Which secret or token the work needs, who creates it, where it is kept,
  and what it may access.
- **Contract changes.** The work needs the shared cross-repo surface (the locked `contract.md`) to
  change. Nobody decides this here, and no answer lets the step go on: it goes back to the
  architecture gate, or, on a short lane, to a new epic on `classic`. Name it in the batch so the
  person learns it now, not halfway through. Then end the step with this skill's own contract STOP
  (`yad-spec` Step 3, `yad-implement` Step 5), and its `contract touch` halt under `yad-run`.
- **Changes that cannot be undone.** Deleting data, or a data migration with no way back.

**How to ask:**
1. Number each item. For each one, say what must be decided, why only a human can decide it, and the
   options, with your recommendation where a safe one exists.
2. Wait for the answers, then record them where the step below says, so no later step asks again.
   `yad-implement` first reads the answers `yad-spec` recorded in `spec.md`, and asks only what is
   still open.
3. If nothing is open, say "no human-only decisions or open questions" and go on.
4. If a new one still turns up later, stop, collect any others that are open at that point, and ask
   them together. In the report, say the first batch missed it.
5. **Run by the orchestrator (`yad-run`):** a stop to ask — the first batch or a later one — is its
   own halt, **waiting on human decisions**. Run `yad build step <story> --repo <repo> <step> blocked
   --reason "waiting on human decisions: <the questions, short>"` (add `--task <task>` on the
   implement leg). Write **no** trust entry: the step's output is not finished, and files already
   drafted (such as `spec.md`) are not output to judge. Then stop. Once a person answers, the step
   runs again and goes on from what is already drafted. That is a resume, not a re-run, so it is not
   graded `rejected` for being run again.

<!-- end: Ask the human-only questions first -->

## On Activation

### Step 1 — Resolve the story and check readiness
Read `{project-root}/epics/<epic>/.sdlc/state.json`. Proceed only when
`currentStep == "ready-for-build"` (the gating Shape — through the **stories** gate — is `done`).
The **`test-cases` track may still be `in_progress`**: it is parallel and non-blocking, so Build runs alongside it — its status does not affect readiness here. Read the story file
`epics/<epic>/stories/<story>.md`; confirm `repo` is in its `repos`. If the epic is not ready, STOP
and point the user at `yad-status`. **Do not mutate Shape state** — `ready-for-build` semantics
stay intact.

### Step 2 — Resolve the target code repo
Map `repo` → `{project-root}/demo-repos/<repo>/`. Confirm it exists and is its own git repo
(`demo-repos/<repo>/.git` present). If missing, STOP and point the user at `demo-repos/README.md`
(how to regenerate the throwaway repo). Operate **inside this repo** with absolute paths.

### Step 3 — Read the contract (reference, do NOT re-invent)
Read `epics/<epic>/contract.md` and `epics/<epic>/.sdlc/contract-lock.json`. The spec's contract
inputs (the API shapes, data-model entities, and events the story touches) are **quoted from the
locked surface**, not re-authored. Each `contracts/` file is Markdown holding the quoted lines, copied
whole and word for word as ONE consecutive run, in one `<!-- CONTRACT-QUOTE:BEGIN -->` …
`<!-- CONTRACT-QUOTE:END -->` block, and nothing else but blank lines and, as the first line, the title
`# Contract slice — <story ID>` (one file per run; notes go in `spec.md` or `plan.md`), so the contract-check gate
can prove it is a quote and needs no `Contract-Change` trailer (see `references/spec-handoff.md`). The spec MUST stay within that surface. If the story needs surface
the contract does not define, STOP and route back to the **architecture gate** — never extend the
contract here. (On a route that HAS one; the short lanes do not — see below.)

- **Short-lane-safe:** read `epics/<epic>/.sdlc/state.json`'s `profile` first (an epic seeded before
  file shape 6 has no such key — fall back to what its `steps[]` contains). On the `chore` and
  `spike` routes there is no architecture step, so `contract.md` and `contract-lock.json` **never
  exist** — that is the route's design, not a missing file to chase. Write the spec from the story and
  `epic.md` alone, record `contract-lock: none` in Step 6's frontmatter, and say in the spec that this
  epic defines no contract surface.
- A short lane has no architecture gate to route back to. So the rule above becomes stricter, not
  looser: if the story turns out to need the shared cross-repo surface to CHANGE, **STOP and escalate
  to a human** — the work belongs to a new epic on `classic`. Do not write the change into a spec on a
  short lane. Do not create `specs/<story>/contracts/` at all on one — a short-lane story has no
  surface to quote, and a slice folder under a lockless epic is what the CI gate refuses. (If one
  already exists, a commit that only DELETES it is allowed through, which is the way back out.)

### Step 4 — Detect Spec Kit
Read Spec Kit's entry in `yad toolbox list --json --dir demo-repos/<repo>`, as **When a tool is
missing** says. If yad cannot answer, check for `/speckit.*` slash-commands and/or
`demo-repos/<repo>/.specify/`. Record the result for Step 6's
frontmatter (`speckit: installed | not-installed`; a light spec records `not-used` whatever is found).

### Step 5 — Run the heavy ceremony ONCE (or degrade)
**Start the step (#348).** From the Product, run `yad build step <story> --repo <repo> <step> in_progress`,
where `<step>` is the lane's current step when it is `spec` or `tasks` (yad-spec runs both). Run
`yad build start <story> --repo <repo>` first if the story has no lane in this repo yet. The command
records the step, and in a repo that uses Spec Kit it points `.specify/feature.json` at `specs/<story>`,
so Spec Kit never writes into the previous story's folder. Run it again on a resume: it changes nothing
that is already right. If the lane is past both steps (a re-run after a rejected spec, say), do not move
the lane: set `.specify/feature.json` to `{"feature_directory":"specs/<story>"}` by hand instead.

**Ask first (#357).** Before the long part of the ceremony, ask the batch that **Ask the human-only
questions first** above describes. Its items come from the story, `epic.md`, the contract read in
Step 3, and the first draft of `spec.md`. Record the answers in `spec.md`, under `## Clarifications`,
as `- Q: <question> → A: <answer>` lines below a `### Session <YYYY-MM-DD>` heading. This is the format
`/speckit.clarify` writes, and both paths below leave the answers there.
When the story qualifies for a **light spec** (below), put that question in the same batch.

**Light spec (#348).** A small story can have one `spec.md` instead of the full set of files. Suggest it
only when ALL of these hold:
- the route is `chore` or `spike`, or `epics/<epic>/.sdlc/change.json` says `depth: defect-fix` or
  `depth: behavioral-no-surface`;
- the story's **Notes for build** says the contract surface touched is none, and Step 3 found nothing
  to quote, so the spec needs no `contracts/` slice;
- nothing marks it high risk: no step in `epics/<epic>/.sdlc/state.json` carries an `auth` or
  `payments` risk tag; the code repo's risk map gives no file the work will touch the level `high`
  (below); and the person has not called it high risk.

**Reading the risk map for it.** The tasks do not exist yet, so judge the files the work will touch
from the draft `spec.md` and the code; if you cannot say which files, do not offer light. Read
`.sdlc/risk-map` as the default branch has it, with `git -C demo-repos/<repo> show
origin/<default>:.sdlc/risk-map` (no file there: the map gives no `high`). `yad risk-map check` reads the
clone's working copy instead, so use its report only when the clone is on the default branch with the
map unchanged. A file's level is the one on the deepest directory listed above it (`./` covers only the
files at the root); `guessed` counts the same as `confirmed`; an `unset` line, or a file no line covers,
is not high. The map gives **no answer**, so do not offer light, when its first line is not
`# yad-risk-map v1`, or a line other than a `#` comment is not `<dir>/ <level> <guessed|confirmed>`
(with an optional `# reason`).

Never suggest it for a story that touches the contract, and never choose it yourself: ask in the batch
("Light spec — one `spec.md` holding the spec, the plan and the tasks?"), with the reason it qualifies,
and record the answer in `## Clarifications`. Without a clear yes, write the full spec. A light spec:
- is **only** `spec.md` and `link.md` under `demo-repos/<repo>/specs/<story>/`. `spec.md` holds the spec,
  then `## Plan` (the approach, in a few lines), then `## Tasks`. No `research.md`, `data-model.md`,
  `plan.md`, `tasks.md` or `contracts/`. A re-run that turns a full spec into a light one deletes
  everything else in the folder (a `tasks.md` that is still there wins over the light block);
- keeps its tasks between the two marker lines `<!-- yad:tasks -->` and `<!-- /yad:tasks -->` under
  `## Tasks`, once each, in the same shape as `tasks.md` (`## T01 — <goal>` and a **Files:** list).
  `yad build done` and `yad-implement` read the tasks only from between the markers;
- does not run Spec Kit, whose commands need `plan.md` and `tasks.md`. Step 6 records `speckit: not-used`
  and `spec-mode: light`.

**When it qualifies, ask before any Spec Kit command.** Draft `spec.md` by hand and ask the batch, the
light question in it, before running any `/speckit.*` command, so the choice is known before the path
is. On a yes, write the light spec. On a no, take one of the two paths below; on **Used**, the batch is
already asked, so copy the recorded `## Clarifications` lines out first (`/speckit.specify` replaces
`spec.md` with its template), then put them into the `spec.md` it writes instead of asking again.

The spec leg writes the whole light spec, tasks included. When the lane then reaches the `tasks` leg,
start that step as above and check that the tasks block is there and whole; write nothing else.

**Used** (and the spec is not light) — from inside `demo-repos/<repo>/`, drive, in order:
`/speckit.specify` → (ask the batch) → `/speckit.clarify` → `/speckit.plan` → `/speckit.analyze` →
`/speckit.checklist` → `/speckit.tasks`. **Pin the feature to `<story>`** (do not accept an
auto-slug): start `/speckit.specify` with `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY=specs/<story>`, because without it
specify makes a numbered folder of its own. Before `/speckit.plan` and again before `/speckit.tasks`,
check that `.specify/feature.json` still names `specs/<story>`; if it does not, set it back to
`{"feature_directory":"specs/<story>"}`. Seed `specify` from the story's acceptance criteria and the contract elements from Step 3.
On a resume after a question halt, keep the `spec.md` that `/speckit.specify` already wrote: do not run
it again. A hand draft made only to ask the light question is not that: run `/speckit.specify` and carry
its `## Clarifications` in. Tell them apart by `specs/<story>/checklists/requirements.md`: specify
writes it, a hand draft never does. Answer `/speckit.clarify`'s questions from the batch answers. A question it asks that the batch did not
cover is a late one: ask all such questions together, as rule 4 of the batch says.
`/speckit.constitution` and `/speckit.implement` are **out of scope for Step A** (implement is Step B).

**Not used (degrade)** (and the spec is not light) — draft `spec.md` first, ask the batch, record the answers in it, and only then
write the rest (after a "no" to light, the batch is already asked: do not ask it again). Hand-author the identical files in Spec Kit's layout under
`demo-repos/<repo>/specs/<story>/`: `spec.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`,
`plan.md`, `tasks.md`. Write `contracts/` only when Step 3 found surface to quote: a story with nothing to
quote has no `contracts/` folder at all (git keeps no empty folder, and an empty one quotes nothing). The content is what a real Spec Kit run would produce, traceable to the story's
acceptance criteria and the locked contract surface. `tasks.md` MUST be numbered atomic tasks (`T01…`),
each declaring the files it may touch, so Step B's "stay inside the declared files" rule has something
to read. See `references/spec-handoff.md` for the exact file map and per-file degradation rules.

### Step 6 — Write link.md back to the story
Write `demo-repos/<repo>/specs/<story>/link.md` (template in `references/spec-handoff.md`) with
frontmatter linking the spec back to the product repo: `story`, `epic`, `repo`, `feature-id`,
`product-repo` (path — when the code repo has `.sdlc/product-link.json`, write `../../<its path>`, the
place CI checks the Product out; the gates read that record first anyway), `contract-lock` (the hash **copied** from `contract-lock.json`, NOT recomputed
in the code repo — or the literal `none` on a short-lane epic, which has no lock; never a made-up or
empty hash, which the CI gate reads as a broken lock and fails), `speckit`
(`installed | not-installed`, or `not-used` for a light spec), `spec-mode` (`light` for a light spec,
else `full`; nothing after the value on that line), `generated` (date). This `link.md` plus the
spec folder is the authoritative record that this story's spec exists.

### Step 7 — Stop (Shape state untouched)
Report: the spec folder path, the files written, whether Spec Kit was used, the task count from
`tasks.md` (or the light spec's tasks block), whether the spec is light, and that the next action is **Step B — `yad-implement`**. Do **not** edit the epic's
`state.json`, `approvals.json`, or `contract-lock.json`. Step A is a generation step, not a Shape gate.

### Step 8 — Record the `spec` trust signal (Phase 4b)
When this step runs under the orchestrator (`yad-run`), the generated spec is a Build run that the
trust log measures (part of the run record `yad dial` shows beside the `spec` dial). The
verdict is **anchored to the human who accepts the spec**, never self-graded:
- the human approves the generated `specs/<story>/` untouched → `approved-unchanged`;
- the human edits the spec/plan/tasks before accepting → `approved-with-edits` (signal
  `human_edited_spec: true`);
- the spec is rejected or the ceremony re-run → `rejected` (a resume after a question halt, #357, is
  not a re-run).
`yad-run` records a provisional entry when the spec is generated; this acceptance finalizes it (same
pattern as the engineer review finalizing `implement` at `yad-engineer-review`). Finalize it with
`yad build trust <story> --repo <repo> spec --uid <uid> --verdict <v>` — the `uid` is `closed.run` on the
`spec` step in `build-state/<story>.json`. Never write the shard by hand. Schema:
`../yad-epic/references/state-schema.md`. **Run standalone, no trust entry is written** — the
log measures orchestrated runs. The record is advice: the `spec` dial is
whatever the team sets with `yad dial`, and this step never changes it.

## Hard rules (build plan §A, Cross-cutting)

- **Heavy spec once per story, not per task.** specify/clarify/plan/analyze/checklist/tasks run once
  per story per repo. Do not re-run the ceremony for each task. A **light spec** (#348) skips it, and only
  when a human confirms it in the batch.
- **Per-repo spec, shared contract.** Spec/plan/tasks live in the code repo; the contract stays
  singular in the product repo. Never widen the contract surface from here.
- **Nothing auto-advances.** Step A generates files and stops; no state machine is advanced. Step 5
  only starts the lane's spec or tasks step (`in_progress`); it never closes one.
- **Human-only decisions are asked first, in one batch** (#357), before the long work — never decided
  by the agent.
