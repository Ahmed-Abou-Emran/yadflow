// Every command module, behind ONE dynamic import (E11 review).
//
// `yad hook ledger-guard` runs on EVERY file-editing tool call an agent makes, inside its tool
// loop. It needs `cli/hook.mjs` and nothing else, but a static import list in `bin/yad.mjs` is
// hoisted and evaluated before any code runs — so the hook was loading all 29 modules of the CLI,
// measured at ~30ms against ~14ms for what it actually uses, on every single edit.
//
// Re-exporting through one module keeps that mechanical: `bin/yad.mjs` awaits this once, after it
// has already handled `hook`, and every command reads off the result. Nothing here is lazy in
// itself — importing this file still loads everything, which is exactly right for a command that
// is about to do real work.
