  yad new <name>       Greenfield: make <name>/product/, git init it, run setup inside it. Creates
                       no remote — prints the gh/glab line to run yourself. Takes the setup flags
  yad init             Brownfield, in the folder that already holds your repos: make product/ (or
                       use the one there; --path <folder> names it), run setup, offer each repo found
  yad join <url> [folder]
                       Clone the Product into [folder]/product/ (default: the URL's last name) and
                       every repo it registers; a failed repo clone is reported, never fatal. Then
                       only per-machine steps: git-ignored skill copies + the git pre-commit hook.

${c.bold('Setup & maintenance')}
  yad setup            Guided first-run setup (profile interview, install, connect & wire repos,
                       then the tools this project uses that are missing — offered, never installed)
                       profile flags: --solo | --team <n>, --greenfield | --brownfield,
                       --monorepo | --separate, --tools (configure design/testing/learning now)
  yad check            Report what is missing / drifted / modified / stale / legacy (read-only)
  yad check --fix      Reconcile: fill what is missing, update what changed
  yad update           Apply drift only (alias for: check --fix --scope=changed);
                       installs newly-added skills, updates changed skills + gate scripts,
                       and migrates pre-2.0 sdlc-* installs to the yad-* names.
                       A managed file whose edit yad can prove (its recorded sha) is
                       reported 'modified' and left alone; --overwrite-local replaces
                       it. Anything else it cannot account for is replaced only after
                       a <file>.yad-orig backup
  yad update --push    Also commit each repo's applied changes and push them straight to the
                       default branch of the Product + every connected repo (a chore(yad-update)
                       commit; no PR — the push-on-main yad-update-guard runs verified-commits
                       + commit-message). Announce the team & pause merges first. Also works as
                       'yad check --fix --push'; --allow-branch permits a non-default branch
  yad doctor [--json]  Environment + state health: tools/auth, config files,
                       repo paths, epic ledgers (exit 1 on any failure)
  yad migrate [--apply] [--keep product|hub] [--json]   Move this project's state files onto the shape
                       this yadflow expects. Prints what WOULD change and writes
                       nothing until --apply, which copies each file it rewrites to
                       <file>.yad-orig first. Safe to run twice — the second run
                       reports there is nothing to do. When .sdlc/product.json and
                       .sdlc/hub.json (or an epic's product-prs.json and hub-prs.json)
                       disagree, --apply asks which copy to keep; --keep answers it
  yad sync-status [epic]   Update artifact frontmatter status (draft/in-review/approved)
                       from .sdlc/state.json — all epics if omitted (--dry-run to preview)
  yad report [-m <text>]   File a bug in the yadflow repo with auto-scrubbed diagnostics
                       (no paths/hosts/repo names/logins/flag values). Also offered
                       automatically after an unexpected failure. YAD_NO_REPORT=1 disables.
  yad hook ledger-guard    ${c.dim('harness-invoked, not typed')} — refuse an agent's edit to the

                       the transition. Reads a tool-call payload on stdin (or --path <p>);
                       exit 0 allows, exit 2 denies with the reason on stderr. With
                       --format cursor the verdict is JSON on stdout instead, for a harness
                       whose pre-edit hook asks for permission rather than reading an exit
                       code. Wired into .claude/settings.json and .cursor/hooks.json by
                       setup / check --fix. With --staged it judges the files a commit is
                       about to record instead — the git pre-commit hook check --fix
                       installs in this clone refuses a person's hand commit to the ledger.

                                       --stub seeds a brownfield anchor instead: the same chain
                                       with every step blocked behind backfill-pending, so a

  yad defer <epic> <step> --reason <text> [--debt]
                                       Set an optional step aside to do LATER: marks it deferred.
                                       Say who is waiting for it in the reason. Same steps and same
                                       refusals as skip; the chain goes on, its review is still owed.
                                       --debt marks it owed back: yad next and yad doctor remind
                                       you until its review passes
  yad undefer <epic> <step>            Put a deferred step back, at any time. After later work has
                                       finished, the step re-opens beside that work, which stays done
  yad unblock <epic> <step>            Clear a recorded blocker once the wait is over: moves the
                                       step off blocked and removes its record in one write
  yad dial <step> [--to auto|human] [--json]
                                       A Shape author step's advance dial, for the whole project (E34),
                                       kept in .sdlc/automation.json. No --to shows it. A review gate is
                                       always human. Recorded only for now: nothing drives a Shape step
                                       on its own until the engine runs agents
  yad dial open-pr [--to auto|human] [--json]
                                       The standing approval to open a task's PR/MR once its checks
                                       pass (\`yad open-pr --via auto\`), for the whole project. The
                                       merge is always a person's; the kill switch holds it at human
  yad dial <epic> <story> --repo <name> <step> [--to auto|human] [--json]
                                       A Build lane step's dial (spec, tasks, implement, checks), in
                                       build-state; on auto the yad-run skill moves past it after a clean
                                       run. Shows the step's run record as advice, never as a rule
  yad kill --reason <text>             Kill switch: hold every step at advance: human. Recorded in
                                       .sdlc/automation.json — who, when and why
  yad unkill [--reason <text>]         Turn the kill switch off; each step follows its own dial again
  yad mode [solo --reason <text> | team [--reason <text>]] [--json]
                                       Who must approve. Solo waives approvals on every review gate (the
                                       merge still decides); team counts them. Records who, when and why.
                                       No word reads the mode. Open reviews follow it from their next sync

${c.bold('Review gate (Shape)')}
  yad gate open <epic> <artifact>      Open the review PR/MR; mark the step in_review. The review

                                       Product's default branch written where CI checks it out (and
                                       removed after). Signatures are checked with git; the platform's
                                       Verified badge is judged in CI. install-deps runs npm ci (it
                                       replaces node_modules); --no-build skips it and build/test/lint.

  yad open-pr [--repo <name>] [--title <text>] [--via auto]
                                       Open a task PR/MR against the repo's DEFAULT branch (never a
                                       hardcoded main; --base overrides) — stage-aware on the Product: a
                                       review/EP-* branch opens the Shape artifact-review PR
                                       (delegates to gate open), any other Product branch uses the
                                       code-task template. --title sets the PR/MR title (default: -m,
                                       else the last commit's subject). --via auto: opened on the

                                       (merged before ledger tracking), then carry its status: shipped

  yad repo refresh [name] [--push]     Re-pack a stale repo (a human decision). --push commits the
